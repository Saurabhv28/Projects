in byre and hut for loosed till dawn are we this is hour of pride and power talon and tush and claw oh hear call -- good hunting all that keep jungle law night-song in jungle it was seven ’ clock of very warm evening in seeonee hills when father wolf woke up from his day ’ rest scratched himself yawned and spread out his paws one after other get rid of sleepy feeling in their tips mother wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling squealing cubs and moon shone into mouth of cave where they all lived “ augrh ” said father wolf “ it is time hunt again. ” he was going spring down hill when little shadow with bushy tail crossed threshold and whined : “ good luck go with you chief of wolves and good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget hungry in this world. ” it was jackal -- tabaqui dish-licker -- and wolves of india despise tabaqui because he runs about making mischief and telling tales and eating rags and pieces of leather from village rubbish-heaps but they are afraid of him because tabaqui more than anyone else in jungle is apt go mad and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone and runs through forest biting everything in his way even tiger runs and hides when little tabaqui goes mad for madness is most disgraceful thing that can overtake wild creature we call it hydrophobia but they call it dewanee -- madness -- and run “ enter then and look ” said father wolf stiffly “ but there is no food here. ” “ for wolf no ” said tabaqui “ but for so mean person as myself dry bone is good feast who are we gidur-log [ jackal people ] pick and choose ” he scuttled back of cave where he found bone of buck with some meat on it and sat cracking end merrily “ all thanks for this good meal ” he said licking his lips “ how beautiful are noble children how large are their eyes and so young indeed indeed i might have remembered that children of kings are men from beginning. ” now tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as compliment children their faces it pleased him see mother and father wolf look uncomfortable tabaqui sat still rejoicing in mischief that he had made and then he said spitefully : “ shere khan big one has shifted his hunting grounds he will hunt among these hills for next moon so he has told me. ” shere khan was tiger who lived near waingunga river twenty miles away “ he has no right ” father wolf began angrily -- “ by law of jungle he has no right change his quarters without due warning he will frighten every head of game within ten miles and i -- i have kill for two these days. ” “ his mother did not call him lungri [ lame one ] for nothing ” said mother wolf quietly “ he has been lame in one foot from his birth that is why he has only killed cattle now villagers of waingunga are angry with him and he has come here make our villagers angry they will scour jungle for him when he is far away and we and our children must run when grass is set alight indeed we are very grateful shere khan ” “ shall i tell him of your gratitude ” said tabaqui “ out ” snapped father wolf “ out and hunt with thy master thou hast done harm enough for one night. ” “ i go ” said tabaqui quietly “ ye can hear shere khan below in thickets i might have saved myself message. ” father wolf listened and below in valley that ran down little river he heard dry angry snarly singsong whine of tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all jungle knows it “ fool ” said father wolf “ begin night ’ work with that noise does he think that our buck are like his fat waingunga bullocks ” “ h ’ sh it is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night ” said mother wolf “ it is man. ” whine had changed sort of humming purr that seemed come from every quarter of compass it was noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in open and makes them run sometimes into very mouth of tiger “ man ” said father wolf showing all his white teeth “ faugh are there not enough beetles and frogs in tanks that he must eat man and on our ground ” law of jungle which never orders anything without reason forbids every beast eat man except when he is killing show his children how kill and then he must hunt outside hunting grounds of his pack or tribe real reason for this is that man-killing means sooner or later arrival of white men on elephants with guns and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches then everybody in jungle suffers reason beasts give among themselves is that man is weakest and most defenseless of all living things and it is unsportsmanlike touch him they say -- and it is true -- that man-eaters become mangy and lose their teeth purr grew louder and ended in full-throated “ aaarh ” of tiger ’ charge then there was howl -- an untigerish howl -- from shere khan “ he has missed ” said mother wolf “ what is it ” father wolf ran out few paces and heard shere khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in scrub “ fool has had no more sense than jump at woodcutter ’ campfire and has burned his feet ” said father wolf with grunt “ tabaqui is with him. ” “ something is coming uphill ” said mother wolf twitching one ear “ get ready. ” bushes rustled little in thicket and father wolf dropped with his haunches under him ready for his leap then if you had been watching you would have seen most wonderful thing in world -- wolf checked in mid-spring he made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at and then he tried stop himself result was that he shot up straight into air for four or five feet landing almost where he left ground “ man ” he snapped “ man ’ cub look ” directly in front of him holding on by low branch stood naked brown baby who could just walk -- as soft and as dimpled little atom as ever came wolf ’ cave at night he looked up into father wolf ’ face and laughed “ is that man ’ cub ” said mother wolf “ i have never seen one bring it here. ” wolf accustomed moving his own cubs can if necessary mouth an egg without breaking it and though father wolf ’ jaws closed right on child ’ back not tooth even scratched skin as he laid it down among cubs “ how little how naked and -- how bold ” said mother wolf softly baby was pushing his way between cubs get close warm hide “ ahai he is taking his meal with others and so this is man ’ cub now was there ever wolf that could boast of man ’ cub among her children ” “ i have heard now and again of such thing but never in our pack or in my time ” said father wolf “ he is altogether without hair and i could kill him with touch of my foot but see he looks up and is not afraid. ” moonlight was blocked out of mouth of cave for shere khan ’ great square head and shoulders were thrust into entrance tabaqui behind him was squeaking : “ my lord my lord it went in here ” “ shere khan does us great honor ” said father wolf but his eyes were very angry “ what does shere khan need ” “ my quarry man ’ cub went this way ” said shere khan “ its parents have run off give it me. ” shere khan had jumped at woodcutter ’ campfire as father wolf had said and was furious from pain of his burned feet but father wolf knew that mouth of cave was narrow for tiger come in by even where he was shere khan ’ shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room as man ’ would be if he tried fight in barrel “ wolves are free people ” said father wolf “ they take orders from head of pack and not from any striped cattle-killer man ’ cub is ours -- kill if we choose. ” “ ye choose and ye do not choose what talk is this of choosing by bull that i killed am i stand nosing into your dog ’ den for my fair dues it is i shere khan who speak ” tiger ’ roar filled cave with thunder mother wolf shook herself clear of cubs and sprang forward her eyes like two green moons in darkness facing blazing eyes of shere khan “ and it is i raksha [ demon ] who answers man ’ cub is mine lungri -- mine he shall not be killed he shall live run with pack and hunt with pack ; and in end look you hunter of little naked cubs -- frog-eater -- fish-killer -- he shall hunt thee now get hence or by sambhur that i killed ( i eat no starved cattle ) back thou goest thy mother burned beast of jungle lamer than ever thou camest into world go ” father wolf looked on amazed he had almost forgotten days when he won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolves when she ran in pack and was not called demon for compliment ’ sake shere khan might have faced father wolf but he could not stand up against mother wolf for he knew that where he was she had all advantage of ground and would fight death so he backed out of cave mouth growling and when he was clear he shouted : “ each dog barks in his own yard we will see what pack will say this fostering of man-cubs cub is mine and my teeth he will come in end bush-tailed thieves ” mother wolf threw herself down panting among cubs and father wolf said her gravely : “ shere khan speaks this much truth cub must be shown pack wilt thou still keep him mother ” “ keep him ” she gasped “ he came naked by night alone and very hungry ; yet he was not afraid look he has pushed one of my babes one side already and that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off waingunga while villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge keep him assuredly i will keep him lie still little frog thou mowgli -- for mowgli frog i will call thee -- time will come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he has hunted thee. ” “ but what will our pack say ” said father wolf law of jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may when he marries withdraw from pack he belongs but as soon as his cubs are old enough stand on their feet he must bring them pack council which is generally held once month at full moon in order that other wolves may identify them after that inspection cubs are free run where they please and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if grown wolf of pack kills one of them punishment is death where murderer can be found ; and if you think for minute you will see that this must be so father wolf waited till his cubs could run little and then on night of pack meeting took them and mowgli and mother wolf council rock -- hilltop covered with stones and boulders where hundred wolves could hide akela great gray lone wolf who led all pack by strength and cunning lay out at full length on his rock and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color from badger-colored veterans who could handle buck alone young black three-year-olds who thought they could lone wolf had led them for year now he had fallen twice into wolf trap in his youth and once he had been beaten and left for dead ; so he knew manners and customs of men there was very little talking at rock cubs tumbled over each other in center of circle where their mothers and fathers sat and now and again senior wolf would go quietly up cub look at him carefully and return his place on noiseless feet sometimes mother would push her cub far out into moonlight be sure that he had not been overlooked akela from his rock would cry : “ ye know law -- ye know law look well wolves ” and anxious mothers would take up call : “ look -- look well wolves ” at last -- and mother wolf ’ neck bristles lifted as time came -- father wolf pushed “ mowgli frog ” as they called him into center where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in moonlight akela never raised his head from his paws but went on with monotonous cry : “ look well ” muffled roar came up from behind rocks -- voice of shere khan crying : “ cub is mine give him what have free people do with man ’ cub ” akela never even twitched his ears all he said was : “ look well wolves what have free people do with orders of any save free people look well ” there was chorus of deep growls and young wolf in his fourth year flung back shere khan ’ question akela : “ what have free people do with man ’ cub ” now law of jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as right of cub be accepted by pack he must be spoken for by at least two members of pack who are not his father and mother “ who speaks for this cub ” said akela “ among free people who speaks ” there was no answer and mother wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight if things came fighting then only other creature who is allowed at pack council -- baloo sleepy brown bear who teaches wolf cubs law of jungle : old baloo who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey -- rose upon his hind quarters and grunted “ man ’ cub -- man ’ cub ” he said “ i speak for man ’ cub there is no harm in man ’ cub i have no gift of words but i speak truth let him run with pack and be entered with others i myself will teach him. ” “ we need yet another ” said akela “ baloo has spoken and he is our teacher for young cubs who speaks besides baloo ” black shadow dropped down into circle it was bagheera black panther inky black all over but with panther markings showing up in certain lights like pattern of watered silk everybody knew bagheera and nobody cared cross his path ; for he was as cunning as tabaqui as bold as wild buffalo and as reckless as wounded elephant but he had voice as soft as wild honey dripping from tree and skin softer than down “ akela and ye free people ” he purred “ i have no right in your assembly but law of jungle says that if there is doubt which is not killing matter in regard new cub life of that cub may be bought at price and law does not say who may or may not pay that price am i right ” “ good good ” said young wolves who are always hungry “ listen bagheera cub can be bought for price it is law. ” “ knowing that i have no right speak here i ask your leave. ” “ speak then ” cried twenty voices “ kill naked cub is shame besides he may make better sport for you when he is grown baloo has spoken in his behalf now baloo ’ word i will add one bull and fat one newly killed not half mile from here if ye will accept man ’ cub according law is it difficult ” there was clamor of scores of voices saying : “ what matter he will die in winter rains he will scorch in sun what harm can naked frog do us let him run with pack where is bull bagheera let him be accepted. ” and then came akela ’ deep bay crying : “ look well -- look well wolves ” mowgli was still deeply interested in pebbles and he did not notice when wolves came and looked at him one by one at last they all went down hill for dead bull and only akela bagheera baloo and mowgli ’ own wolves were left shere khan roared still in night for he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over him “ ay roar well ” said bagheera under his whiskers “ for time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar another tune or i know nothing of man. ” “ it was well done ” said akela “ men and their cubs are very wise he may be help in time. ” “ truly help in time of need ; for none can hope lead pack forever ” said bagheera akela said nothing he was thinking of time that comes every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler till at last he is killed by wolves and new leader comes up -- be killed in his turn “ take him away ” he said father wolf “ and train him as befits one of free people. ” and that is how mowgli was entered into seeonee wolf pack for price of bull and on baloo ’ good word now you must be content skip ten or eleven whole years and only guess at all wonderful life that mowgli led among wolves because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books he grew up with cubs though they of course were grown wolves almost before he was child and father wolf taught him his business and meaning of things in jungle till every rustle in grass every breath of warm night air every note of owls above his head every scratch of bat ’ claws as it roosted for while in tree and every splash of every little fish jumping in pool meant just as much him as work of his office means business man when he was not learning he sat out in sun and slept and ate and went sleep again when he felt dirty or hot he swam in forest pools ; and when he wanted honey ( baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant eat as raw meat ) he climbed up for it and that bagheera showed him how do bagheera would lie out on branch and call “ come along little brother ” and at first mowgli would cling like sloth but afterward he would fling himself through branches almost as boldly as gray ape he took his place at council rock when pack met and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf wolf would be forced drop his eyes and so he used stare for fun at other times he would pick long thorns out of pads of his friends for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats he would go down hillside into cultivated lands by night and look very curiously at villagers in their huts but he had mistrust of men because bagheera showed him square box with drop gate so cunningly hidden in jungle that he nearly walked into it and told him that it was trap he loved better than anything else go with bagheera into dark warm heart of forest sleep all through drowsy day and at night see how bagheera did his killing bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry and so did mowgli -- with one exception as soon as he was old enough understand things bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into pack at price of bull ’ life “ all jungle is thine ” said bagheera “ and thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough kill ; but for sake of bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old that is law of jungle. ” mowgli obeyed faithfully and he grew and grew strong as boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons and who has nothing in world think of except things eat mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not creature be trusted and that some day he must kill shere khan but though young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour mowgli forgot it because he was only boy -- though he would have called himself wolf if he had been able speak in any human tongue shere khan was always crossing his path in jungle for as akela grew older and feebler lame tiger had come be great friends with younger wolves of pack who followed him for scraps thing akela would never have allowed if he had dared push his authority proper bounds then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content be led by dying wolf and man ’ cub “ they tell ” shere khan would say “ that at council ye dare not look him between eyes. ” and young wolves would growl and bristle bagheera who had eyes and ears everywhere knew something of this and once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill him some day mowgli would laugh and answer : “ i have pack and i have thee ; and baloo though he is so lazy might strike blow or two for my sake why should i be afraid ” it was one very warm day that new notion came bagheera -- born of something that he had heard perhaps ikki porcupine had told him ; but he said mowgli when they were deep in jungle as boy lay with his head on bagheera ’ beautiful black skin “ little brother how often have i told thee that shere khan is thy enemy ” “ as many times as there are nuts on that palm ” said mowgli who naturally could not count “ what of it i am sleepy bagheera and shere khan is all long tail and loud talk -- like mao peacock. ” “ but this is no time for sleeping baloo knows it ; i know it ; pack know it ; and even foolish foolish deer know tabaqui has told thee too. ” “ ho ho ” said mowgli “ tabaqui came not long ago with some rude talk that i was naked man ’ cub and not fit dig pig-nuts but i caught tabaqui by tail and swung him twice against palm-tree teach him better manners. ” “ that was foolishness for though tabaqui is mischief-maker he would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely open those eyes little brother shere khan dare not kill thee in jungle but remember akela is very old and soon day comes when he can not kill his buck and then he will be leader no more many of wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought council first are old and young wolves believe as shere khan has taught them that man-cub has no place with pack in little time thou wilt be man. ” “ and what is man that he should not run with his brothers ” said mowgli “ i was born in jungle i have obeyed law of jungle and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws i have not pulled thorn surely they are my brothers ” bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes “ little brother ” said he “ feel under my jaw. ” mowgli put up his strong brown hand and just under bagheera ’ silky chin where giant rolling muscles were all hid by glossy hair he came upon little bald spot “ there is no one in jungle that knows that i bagheera carry that mark -- mark of collar ; and yet little brother i was born among men and it was among men that my mother died -- in cages of king ’ palace at oodeypore it was because of this that i paid price for thee at council when thou wast little naked cub yes i was born among men i had never seen jungle they fed behind bars from an iron pan till one night i felt that i was bagheera -- panther -- and no man ’ plaything and i broke silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away and because i had learned ways of men i became more terrible in jungle than shere khan is it not so ” “ yes ” said mowgli “ all jungle fear bagheera -- all except mowgli. ” “ oh thou art man ’ cub ” said black panther very tenderly “ and even as i returned my jungle so thou must go back men at last -- men who are thy brothers -- if thou art not killed in council. ” “ but why -- but why should any wish kill ” said mowgli “ look at ” said bagheera and mowgli looked at him steadily between eyes big panther turned his head away in half minute “ that is why ” he said shifting his paw on leaves “ not even i can look thee between eyes and i was born among men and i love thee little brother others they hate thee because their eyes can not meet thine ; because thou art wise ; because thou hast pulled out thorns from their feet -- because thou art man. ” “ i did not know these things ” said mowgli sullenly and he frowned under his heavy black eyebrows “ what is law of jungle strike first and then give tongue by thy very carelessness they know that thou art man but be wise it is in my heart that when akela misses his next kill -- and at each hunt it costs him more pin buck -- pack will turn against him and against thee they will hold jungle council at rock and then -- and then -- i have it ” said bagheera leaping up “ go thou down quickly men ’ huts in valley and take some of red flower which they grow there so that when time comes thou mayest have even stronger friend than i or baloo or those of pack that love thee get red flower. ” by red flower bagheera meant fire only no creature in jungle will call fire by its proper name every beast lives in deadly fear of it and invents hundred ways of describing it “ red flower ” said mowgli “ that grows outside their huts in twilight i will get some. ” “ there speaks man ’ cub ” said bagheera proudly “ remember that it grows in little pots get one swiftly and keep it by thee for time of need. ” “ good ” said mowgli “ i go but art thou sure my bagheera ” -- he slipped his arm around splendid neck and looked deep into big eyes -- “ art thou sure that all this is shere khan ’ doing ” “ by broken lock that freed i am sure little brother. ” “ then by bull that bought i will pay shere khan full tale for this and it may be little over ” said mowgli and he bounded away “ that is man that is all man ” said bagheera himself lying down again “ oh shere khan never was blacker hunting than that frog-hunt of thine ten years ago ” mowgli was far and far through forest running hard and his heart was hot in him he came cave as evening mist rose and drew breath and looked down valley cubs were out but mother wolf at back of cave knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog “ what is it son ” she said “ some bat ’ chatter of shere khan ” he called back “ i hunt among plowed fields tonight ” and he plunged downward through bushes stream at bottom of valley there he checked for he heard yell of pack hunting heard bellow of hunted sambhur and snort as buck turned at bay then there were wicked bitter howls from young wolves : “ akela akela let lone wolf show his strength room for leader of pack spring akela ” lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold for mowgli heard snap of his teeth and then yelp as sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot he did not wait for anything more but dashed on ; and yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into croplands where villagers lived “ bagheera spoke truth ” he panted as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by window of hut “ to-morrow is one day both for akela and for me. ” then he pressed his face close window and watched fire on hearth he saw husbandman ’ wife get up and feed it in night with black lumps and when morning came and mists were all white and cold he saw man ’ child pick up wicker pot plastered inside with earth fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal put it under his blanket and go out tend cows in byre “ is that all ” said mowgli “ if cub can do it there is nothing fear. ” so he strode round corner and met boy took pot from his hand and disappeared into mist while boy howled with fear “ they are very like ” said mowgli blowing into pot as he had seen woman do “ this thing will die if i do not give it things eat ” ; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on red stuff halfway up hill he met bagheera with morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat “ akela has missed ” said panther “ they would have killed him last night but they needed thee also they were looking for thee on hill. ” “ i was among plowed lands i am ready see ” mowgli held up fire-pot “ good now i have seen men thrust dry branch into that stuff and presently red flower blossomed at end of it art thou not afraid ” “ no why should i fear i remember now -- if it is not dream -- how before i was wolf i lay beside red flower and it was warm and pleasant. ” all that day mowgli sat in cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry branches into it see how they looked he found branch that satisfied him and in evening when tabaqui came cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at council rock he laughed till tabaqui ran away then mowgli went council still laughing akela lone wolf lay by side of his rock as sign that leadership of pack was open and shere khan with his following of scrap-fed wolves walked and fro openly being flattered bagheera lay close mowgli and fire pot was between mowgli ’ knees when they were all gathered together shere khan began speak -- thing he would never have dared do when akela was in his prime “ he has no right ” whispered bagheera “ say so he is dog ’ son he will be frightened. ” mowgli sprang his feet “ free people ” he cried “ does shere khan lead pack what has tiger do with our leadership ” “ seeing that leadership is yet open and being asked speak -- ” shere khan began “ by whom ” said mowgli “ are we all jackals fawn on this cattle butcher leadership of pack is with pack alone. ” there were yells of “ silence thou man ’ cub ” “ let him speak he has kept our law ” ; and at last seniors of pack thundered : “ let dead wolf speak. ” when leader of pack has missed his kill he is called dead wolf as long as he lives which is not long akela raised his old head wearily : -- “ free people and ye jackals of shere khan for twelve seasons i have led ye and from kill and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed now i have missed my kill ye know how that plot was made ye know how ye brought up an untried buck make my weakness known it was cleverly done your right is kill here on council rock now therefore i ask who comes make an end of lone wolf for it is my right by law of jungle that ye come one by one. ” there was long hush for no single wolf cared fight akela death then shere khan roared : “ bah what have we do with this toothless fool he is doomed die it is man-cub who has lived long free people he was my meat from first give him i am weary of this man-wolf folly he has troubled jungle for ten seasons give man-cub or i will hunt here always and not give you one bone he is man man ’ child and from marrow of my bones i hate him ” then more than half pack yelled : “ man man what has man do with us let him go his own place. ” “ and turn all people of villages against us ” clamored shere khan “ no give him he is man and none of us can look him between eyes. ” akela lifted his head again and said “ he has eaten our food he has slept with us he has driven game for us he has broken no word of law of jungle. ” “ also i paid for him with bull when he was accepted worth of bull is little but bagheera ’ honor is something that he will perhaps fight for ” said bagheera in his gentlest voice “ bull paid ten years ago ” pack snarled “ what do we care for bones ten years old ” “ or for pledge ” said bagheera his white teeth bared under his lip “ well are ye called free people ” “ no man ’ cub can run with people of jungle ” howled shere khan “ give him ” “ he is our brother in all but blood ” akela went on “ and ye would kill him here in truth i have lived long some of ye are eaters of cattle and of others i have heard that under shere khan ’ teaching ye go by dark night and snatch children from villager ’ doorstep therefore i know ye be cowards and it is cowards i speak it is certain that i must die and my life is of no worth or i would offer that in man-cub ’ place but for sake of honor of pack -- little matter that by being without leader ye have forgotten -- i promise that if ye let man-cub go his own place i will not when my time comes die bare one tooth against ye i will die without fighting that will at least save pack three lives more i can not do ; but if ye will i can save ye shame that comes of killing brother against whom there is no fault -- brother spoken for and bought into pack according law of jungle. ” “ he is man -- man -- man ” snarled pack and most of wolves began gather round shere khan whose tail was beginning switch “ now business is in thy hands ” said bagheera mowgli “ we can do no more except fight. ” mowgli stood upright -- fire pot in his hands then he stretched out his arms and yawned in face of council ; but he was furious with rage and sorrow for wolflike wolves had never told him how they hated him “ listen you ” he cried “ there is no need for this dog ’ jabber ye have told so often tonight that i am man ( and indeed i would have been wolf with you my life ’ end ) that i feel your words are true so i do not call ye my brothers any more but sag [ dogs ] as man should what ye will do and what ye will not do is not yours say that matter is with ; and that we may see matter more plainly i man have brought here little of red flower which ye dogs fear. ” he flung fire pot on ground and some of red coals lit tuft of dried moss that flared up as all council drew back in terror before leaping flames mowgli thrust his dead branch into fire till twigs lit and crackled and whirled it above his head among cowering wolves “ thou art master ” said bagheera in an undertone “ save akela from death he was ever thy friend. ” akela grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life gave one piteous look at mowgli as boy stood all naked his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in light of blazing branch that made shadows jump and quiver “ good ” said mowgli staring round slowly “ i see that ye are dogs i go from you my own people -- if they be my own people jungle is shut and i must forget your talk and your companionship but i will be more merciful than ye are because i was all but your brother in blood i promise that when i am man among men i will not betray ye men as ye have betrayed me. ” he kicked fire with his foot and sparks flew up “ there shall be no war between any of us in pack but here is debt pay before i go. ” he strode forward where shere khan sat blinking stupidly at flames and caught him by tuft on his chin bagheera followed in case of accidents “ up dog ” mowgli cried “ up when man speaks or i will set that coat ablaze ” shere khan ’ ears lay flat back on his head and he shut his eyes for blazing branch was very near “ this cattle-killer said he would kill in council because he had not killed when i was cub thus and thus then do we beat dogs when we are men stir whisker lungri and i ram red flower down thy gullet ” he beat shere khan over head with branch and tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear “ pah singed jungle cat -- go now but remember when next i come council rock as man should come it will be with shere khan ’ hide on my head for rest akela goes free live as he pleases ye will not kill him because that is not my will nor do i think that ye will sit here any longer lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies instead of dogs whom i drive out -- thus go ” fire was burning furiously at end of branch and mowgli struck right and left round circle and wolves ran howling with sparks burning their fur at last there were only akela bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that had taken mowgli ’ part then something began hurt mowgli inside him as he had never been hurt in his life before and he caught his breath and sobbed and tears ran down his face “ what is it what is it ” he said “ i do not wish leave jungle and i do not know what this is am i dying bagheera ” “ no little brother that is only tears such as men use ” said bagheera “ now i know thou art man and man ’ cub no longer jungle is shut indeed thee henceforward let them fall mowgli they are only tears. ” so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break ; and he had never cried in all his life before “ now ” he said “ i will go men but first i must say farewell my mother. ” and he went cave where she lived with father wolf and he cried on her coat while four cubs howled miserably “ ye will not forget ” said mowgli “ never while we can follow trail ” said cubs “ come foot of hill when thou art man and we will talk thee ; and we will come into croplands play with thee by night. ” “ come soon ” said father wolf “ oh wise little frog come again soon ; for we be old thy mother and i. ” “ come soon ” said mother wolf “ little naked son of mine for listen child of man i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs. ” “ i will surely come ” said mowgli “ and when i come it will be lay out shere khan ’ hide upon council rock do not forget tell them in jungle never forget ” dawn was beginning break when mowgli went down hillside alone meet those mysterious things that are called men hunting-song of seeonee pack as dawn was breaking sambhur belled once twice and again and doe leaped up and doe leaped up from pond in wood where wild deer sup this i scouting alone beheld once twice and again as dawn was breaking sambhur belled once twice and again and wolf stole back and wolf stole back carry word waiting pack and we sought and we found and we bayed on his track once twice and again as dawn was breaking wolf pack yelled once twice and again feet in jungle that leave no mark eyes that can see in dark -- dark tongue -- give tongue it hark hark once twice and again kaa ’ hunting his spots are joy of leopard : his horns are buffalo ’ pride be clean for strength of hunter is known by gloss of his hide if ye find that bullock can toss you or heavy-browed sambhur can gore ; ye need not stop work inform us : we knew it ten seasons before oppress not cubs of stranger but hail them as sister and brother for though they are little and fubsy it may be bear is their mother “ there is none like ” says cub in pride of his earliest kill ; but jungle is large and cub he is small let him think and be still maxims of baloo all that is told here happened some time before mowgli was turned out of seeonee wolf pack or revenged himself on shere khan tiger it was in days when baloo was teaching him law of jungle big serious old brown bear was delighted have so quick pupil for young wolves will only learn as much of law of jungle as applies their own pack and tribe and run away as soon as they can repeat hunting verse -- “ feet that make no noise ; eyes that can see in dark ; ears that can hear winds in their lairs and sharp white teeth all these things are marks of our brothers except tabaqui jackal and hyaena whom we hate. ” but mowgli as man-cub had learn great deal more than this sometimes bagheera black panther would come lounging through jungle see how his pet was getting on and would purr with his head against tree while mowgli recited day ’ lesson baloo boy could climb almost as well as he could swim and swim almost as well as he could run so baloo teacher of law taught him wood and water laws : how tell rotten branch from sound one ; how speak politely wild bees when he came upon hive of them fifty feet above ground ; what say mang bat when he disturbed him in branches at midday ; and how warn water-snakes in pools before he splashed down among them none of jungle people like being disturbed and all are very ready fly at an intruder then mowgli was taught strangers ’ hunting call which must be repeated aloud till it is answered whenever one of jungle-people hunts outside his own grounds it means translated “ give leave hunt here because i am hungry. ” and answer is “ hunt then for food but not for pleasure. ” all this will show you how much mowgli had learn by heart and he grew very tired of saying same thing over hundred times but as baloo said bagheera one day when mowgli had been cuffed and run off in temper “ man ’ cub is man ’ cub and he must learn all law of jungle. ” “ but think how small he is ” said black panther who would have spoiled mowgli if he had had his own way “ how can his little head carry all thy long talk ” “ is there anything in jungle little be killed no that is why i teach him these things and that is why i hit him very softly when he forgets. ” “ softly what dost thou know of softness old iron-feet ” bagheera grunted “ his face is all bruised today by thy -- softness ugh. ” “ better he should be bruised from head foot by who love him than that he should come harm through ignorance ” baloo answered very earnestly “ i am now teaching him master words of jungle that shall protect him with birds and snake people and all that hunt on four feet except his own pack he can now claim protection if he will only remember words from all in jungle is not that worth little beating ” “ well look it then that thou dost not kill man-cub he is no tree trunk sharpen thy blunt claws upon but what are those master words i am more likely give help than ask it ” -- bagheera stretched out one paw and admired steel-blue ripping-chisel talons at end of it -- “ still i should like know. ” “ i will call mowgli and he shall say them -- if he will come little brother ” “ my head is ringing like bee tree ” said sullen little voice over their heads and mowgli slid down tree trunk very angry and indignant adding as he reached ground : “ i come for bagheera and not for thee fat old baloo ” “ that is all one ” said baloo though he was hurt and grieved “ tell bagheera then master words of jungle that i have taught thee this day. ” “ master words for which people ” said mowgli delighted show off “ jungle has many tongues i know them all. ” “ little thou knowest but not much see bagheera they never thank their teacher not one small wolfling has ever come back thank old baloo for his teachings say word for hunting-people then -- great scholar. ” “ we be of one blood ye and i ” said mowgli giving words bear accent which all hunting people use “ good now for birds. ” mowgli repeated with kite ’ whistle at end of sentence “ now for snake-people ” said bagheera answer was perfectly indescribable hiss and mowgli kicked up his feet behind clapped his hands together applaud himself and jumped on bagheera ’ back where he sat sideways drumming with his heels on glossy skin and making worst faces he could think of at baloo “ there -- there that was worth little bruise ” said brown bear tenderly “ some day thou wilt remember me. ” then he turned aside tell bagheera how he had begged master words from hathi wild elephant who knows all about these things and how hathi had taken mowgli down pool get snake word from water-snake because baloo could not pronounce it and how mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in jungle because neither snake bird nor beast would hurt him “ no one then is be feared ” baloo wound up patting his big furry stomach with pride “ except his own tribe ” said bagheera under his breath ; and then aloud mowgli “ have care for my ribs little brother what is all this dancing up and down ” mowgli had been trying make himself heard by pulling at bagheera ’ shoulder fur and kicking hard when two listened him he was shouting at top of his voice “ and so i shall have tribe of my own and lead them through branches all day long. ” “ what is this new folly little dreamer of dreams ” said bagheera “ yes and throw branches and dirt at old baloo ” mowgli went on “ they have promised this ah ” “ whoof ” baloo ’ big paw scooped mowgli off bagheera ’ back and as boy lay between big fore-paws he could see bear was angry “ mowgli ” said baloo “ thou hast been talking with bandar-log -- monkey people. ” mowgli looked at bagheera see if panther was angry and bagheera ’ eyes were as hard as jade stones “ thou hast been with monkey people -- gray apes -- people without law -- eaters of everything that is great shame. ” “ when baloo hurt my head ” said mowgli ( he was still on his back ) “ i went away and gray apes came down from trees and had pity on no one else cared. ” he snuffled little “ pity of monkey people ” baloo snorted “ stillness of mountain stream cool of summer sun and then man-cub ” “ and then and then they gave nuts and pleasant things eat and they -- they carried in their arms up top of trees and said i was their blood brother except that i had no tail and should be their leader some day. ” “ they have no leader ” said bagheera “ they lie they have always lied. ” “ they were very kind and bade come again why have i never been taken among monkey people they stand on their feet as i do they do not hit with their hard paws they play all day let get up bad baloo let up i will play with them again. ” “ listen man-cub ” said bear and his voice rumbled like thunder on hot night “ i have taught thee all law of jungle for all peoples of jungle -- except monkey-folk who live in trees they have no law they are outcasts they have no speech of their own but use stolen words which they overhear when they listen and peep and wait up above in branches their way is not our way they are without leaders they have no remembrance they boast and chatter and pretend that they are great people about do great affairs in jungle but falling of nut turns their minds laughter and all is forgotten we of jungle have no dealings with them we do not drink where monkeys drink ; we do not go where monkeys go ; we do not hunt where they hunt ; we do not die where they die hast thou ever heard speak of bandar-log till today ” “ no ” said mowgli in whisper for forest was very still now baloo had finished “ jungle-people put them out of their mouths and out of their minds they are very many evil dirty shameless and they desire if they have any fixed desire be noticed by jungle people but we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads. ” he had hardly spoken when shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through branches ; and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in air among thin branches “ monkey-people are forbidden ” said baloo “ forbidden jungle-people remember. ” “ forbidden ” said bagheera “ but i still think baloo should have warned thee against them. ” “ i -- i how was i guess he would play with such dirt monkey people faugh ” fresh shower came down on their heads and two trotted away taking mowgli with them what baloo had said about monkeys was perfectly true they belonged tree-tops and as beasts very seldom look up there was no occasion for monkeys and jungle-people cross each other ’ path but whenever they found sick wolf or wounded tiger or bear monkeys would torment him and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in hope of being noticed then they would howl and shriek senseless songs and invite jungle-people climb up their trees and fight them or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves and leave dead monkeys where jungle-people could see them they were always just going have leader and laws and customs of their own but they never did because their memories would not hold over from day day and so they compromised things by making up saying “ what bandar-log think now jungle will think later ” and that comforted them great deal none of beasts could reach them but on other hand none of beasts would notice them and that was why they were so pleased when mowgli came play with them and they heard how angry baloo was they never meant do any more -- bandar-log never mean anything at all ; but one of them invented what seemed him brilliant idea and he told all others that mowgli would be useful person keep in tribe because he could weave sticks together for protection from wind ; so if they caught him they could make him teach them of course mowgli as woodcutter ’ child inherited all sorts of instincts and used make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came do it monkey-people watching in trees considered his play most wonderful this time they said they were really going have leader and become wisest people in jungle -- so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them therefore they followed baloo and bagheera and mowgli through jungle very quietly till it was time for midday nap and mowgli who was very much ashamed of himself slept between panther and bear resolving have no more do with monkey people next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms -- hard strong little hands -- and then swash of branches in his face and then he was staring down through swaying boughs as baloo woke jungle with his deep cries and bagheera bounded up trunk with every tooth bared bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled away upper branches where bagheera dared not follow shouting : “ he has noticed us bagheera has noticed us all jungle-people admire us for our skill and our cunning. ” then they began their flight ; and flight of monkey-people through tree-land is one of things nobody can describe they have their regular roads and crossroads up hills and down hills all laid out from fifty seventy or hundred feet above ground and by these they can travel even at night if necessary two of strongest monkeys caught mowgli under arms and swung off with him through treetops twenty feet at bound had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast but boy ’ weight held them back sick and giddy as mowgli was he could not help enjoying wild rush though glimpses of earth far down below frightened him and terrible check and jerk at end of swing over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth his escort would rush him up tree till he felt thinnest topmost branches crackle and bend under them and then with cough and whoop would fling themselves into air outward and downward and bring up hanging by their hands or their feet lower limbs of next tree sometimes he could see for miles and miles across still green jungle as man on top of mast can see for miles across sea and then branches and leaves would lash him across face and he and his two guards would be almost down earth again so bounding and crashing and whooping and yelling whole tribe of bandar-log swept along tree-roads with mowgli their prisoner for time he was afraid of being dropped then he grew angry but knew better than struggle and then he began think first thing was send back word baloo and bagheera for at pace monkeys were going he knew his friends would be left far behind it was useless look down for he could only see topsides of branches so he stared upward and saw far away in blue rann kite balancing and wheeling as he kept watch over jungle waiting for things die rann saw that monkeys were carrying something and dropped few hundred yards find out whether their load was good eat he whistled with surprise when he saw mowgli being dragged up treetop and heard him give kite call for -- “ we be of one blood thou and i. ” waves of branches closed over boy but rann balanced away next tree in time see little brown face come up again “ mark my trail ” mowgli shouted “ tell baloo of seeonee pack and bagheera of council rock. ” “ in whose name brother ” rann had never seen mowgli before though of course he had heard of him “ mowgli frog man-cub they call mark my trail ” last words were shrieked as he was being swung through air but rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than speck of dust and there he hung watching with his telescope eyes swaying of treetops as mowgli ’ escort whirled along “ they never go far ” he said with chuckle “ they never do what they set out do always pecking at new things are bandar-log this time if i have any eye-sight they have pecked down trouble for themselves for baloo is no fledgling and bagheera can as i know kill more than goats. ” so he rocked on his wings his feet gathered up under him and waited meantime baloo and bagheera were furious with rage and grief bagheera climbed as he had never climbed before but thin branches broke beneath his weight and he slipped down his claws full of bark “ why didst thou not warn man-cub ” he roared poor baloo who had set off at clumsy trot in hope of overtaking monkeys “ what was use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him ” “ haste haste we -- we may catch them yet ” baloo panted “ at that speed it would not tire wounded cow teacher of law -- cub-beater -- mile of that rolling and fro would burst thee open sit still and think make plan this is no time for chasing they may drop him if we follow close. ” “ arrula whoo they may have dropped him already being tired of carrying him who can trust bandar-log put dead bats on my head give black bones eat roll into hives of wild bees that i may be stung death and bury with hyaena for i am most miserable of bears arulala wahooa mowgli mowgli why did i not warn thee against monkey-folk instead of breaking thy head now perhaps i may have knocked day ’ lesson out of his mind and he will be alone in jungle without master words. ” baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled and fro moaning “ at least he gave all words correctly little time ago ” said bagheera impatiently “ baloo thou hast neither memory nor respect what would jungle think if i black panther curled myself up like ikki porcupine and howled ” “ what do i care what jungle thinks he may be dead by now. ” “ unless and until they drop him from branches in sport or kill him out of idleness i have no fear for man-cub he is wise and well taught and above all he has eyes that make jungle-people afraid but ( and it is great evil ) he is in power of bandar-log and they because they live in trees have no fear of any of our people. ” bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully “ fool that i am oh fat brown root-digging fool that i am ” said baloo uncoiling himself with jerk “ it is true what hathi wild elephant says : `to each his own fear ’ ; and they bandar-log fear kaa rock snake he can climb as well as they can he steals young monkeys in night whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold let us go kaa. ” “ what will he do for us he is not of our tribe being footless -- and with most evil eyes ” said bagheera “ he is very old and very cunning above all he is always hungry ” said baloo hopefully “ promise him many goats. ” “ he sleeps for full month after he has once eaten he may be asleep now and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats ” bagheera who did not know much about kaa was naturally suspicious “ then in that case thou and i together old hunter might make him see reason. ” here baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against panther and they went off look for kaa rock python they found him stretched out on warm ledge in afternoon sun admiring his beautiful new coat for he had been in retirement for last ten days changing his skin and now he was very splendid -- darting his big blunt-nosed head along ground and twisting thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner come “ he has not eaten ” said baloo with grunt of relief as soon as he saw beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket “ be careful bagheera he is always little blind after he has changed his skin and very quick strike. ” kaa was not poison snake -- in fact he rather despised poison snakes as cowards -- but his strength lay in his hug and when he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more be said “ good hunting ” cried baloo sitting up on his haunches like all snakes of his breed kaa was rather deaf and did not hear call at first then he curled up ready for any accident his head lowered “ good hunting for us all ” he answered “ oho baloo what dost thou do here good hunting bagheera one of us at least needs food is there any news of game afoot doe now or even young buck i am as empty as dried well. ” “ we are hunting ” said baloo carelessly he knew that you must not hurry kaa he is big “ give permission come with you ” said kaa “ blow more or less is nothing thee bagheera or baloo but i -- i have wait and wait for days in wood-path and climb half night on mere chance of young ape psshaw branches are not what they were when i was young rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all. ” “ maybe thy great weight has something do with matter ” said baloo “ i am fair length -- fair length ” said kaa with little pride “ but for all that it is fault of this new-grown timber i came very near falling on my last hunt -- very near indeed -- and noise of my slipping for my tail was not tight wrapped around tree waked bandar-log and they called most evil names. ” “ footless yellow earth-worm ” said bagheera under his whiskers as though he were trying remember something “ sssss have they ever called that ” said kaa “ something of that kind it was that they shouted us last moon but we never noticed them they will say anything -- even that thou hast lost all thy teeth and wilt not face anything bigger than kid because ( they are indeed shameless these bandar-log ) -- because thou art afraid of he-goat ’ horns ” bagheera went on sweetly now snake especially wary old python like kaa very seldom shows that he is angry but baloo and bagheera could see big swallowing muscles on either side of kaa ’ throat ripple and bulge “ bandar-log have shifted their grounds ” he said quietly “ when i came up into sun today i heard them whooping among tree-tops. ” “ it -- it is bandar-log that we follow now ” said baloo but words stuck in his throat for that was first time in his memory that one of jungle-people had owned being interested in doings of monkeys “ beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters -- leaders in their own jungle i am certain -- on trail of bandar-log ” kaa replied courteously as he swelled with curiosity “ indeed ” baloo began “ i am no more than old and sometimes very foolish teacher of law seeonee wolf-cubs and bagheera here -- ” “ is bagheera ” said black panther and his jaws shut with snap for he did not believe in being humble “ trouble is this kaa those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard. ” “ i heard some news from ikki ( his quills make him presumptuous ) of man-thing that was entered into wolf pack but i did not believe ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told. ” “ but it is true he is such man-cub as never was ” said baloo “ best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs -- my own pupil who shall make name of baloo famous through all jungles ; and besides i -- we -- love him kaa. ” “ ts ts ” said kaa weaving his head and fro “ i also have known what love is there are tales i could tell that -- ” “ that need clear night when we are all well fed praise properly ” said bagheera quickly “ our man-cub is in hands of bandar-log now and we know that of all jungle-people they fear kaa alone. ” “ they fear alone they have good reason ” said kaa “ chattering foolish vain -- vain foolish and chattering are monkeys but man-thing in their hands is in no good luck they grow tired of nuts they pick and throw them down they carry branch half day meaning do great things with it and then they snap it in two that man-thing is not be envied they called also -- `yellow fish ’ was it not ” “ worm -- worm -- earth-worm ” said bagheera “ as well as other things which i can not now say for shame. ” “ we must remind them speak well of their master aaa-ssp we must help their wandering memories now whither went they with cub ” “ jungle alone knows toward sunset i believe ” said baloo “ we had thought that thou wouldst know kaa. ” “ i how i take them when they come in my way but i do not hunt bandar-log or frogs -- or green scum on water-hole for that matter. ” “ up up up up hillo illo illo look up baloo of seeonee wolf pack ” baloo looked up see where voice came from and there was rann kite sweeping down with sun shining on upturned flanges of his wings it was near rann ’ bedtime but he had ranged all over jungle looking for bear and had missed him in thick foliage “ what is it ” said baloo “ i have seen mowgli among bandar-log he bade tell you i watched bandar-log have taken him beyond river monkey city -- cold lairs they may stay there for night or ten nights or an hour i have told bats watch through dark time that is my message good hunting all you below ” “ full gorge and deep sleep you rann ” cried bagheera “ i will remember thee in my next kill and put aside head for thee alone best of kites ” “ it is nothing it is nothing boy held master word i could have done no less ” and rann circled up again his roost “ he has not forgotten use his tongue ” said baloo with chuckle of pride “ think of one so young remembering master word for birds while he was being pulled across trees ” “ it was most firmly driven into him ” said bagheera “ but i am proud of him and now we must go cold lairs. ” they all knew where that place was but few of jungle people ever went there because what they called cold lairs was an old deserted city lost and buried in jungle and beasts seldom use place that men have once used wild boar will but hunting tribes do not besides monkeys lived there as much as they could be said live anywhere and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it except in times of drought when half-ruined tanks and reservoirs held little water “ it is half night ’ journey -- at full speed ” said bagheera and baloo looked very serious “ i will go as fast as i can ” he said anxiously “ we dare not wait for thee follow baloo we must go on quick-foot -- kaa and i. ” “ feet or no feet i can keep abreast of all thy four ” said kaa shortly baloo made one effort hurry but had sit down panting and so they left him come on later while bagheera hurried forward at quick panther-canter kaa said nothing but strive as bagheera might huge rock-python held level with him when they came hill stream bagheera gained because he bounded across while kaa swam his head and two feet of his neck clearing water but on level ground kaa made up distance “ by broken lock that freed ” said bagheera when twilight had fallen “ thou art no slow goer ” “ i am hungry ” said kaa “ besides they called speckled frog. ” “ worm -- earth-worm and yellow boot. ” “ all one let us go on ” and kaa seemed pour himself along ground finding shortest road with his steady eyes and keeping it in cold lairs monkey-people were not thinking of mowgli ’ friends at all they had brought boy lost city and were very much pleased with themselves for time mowgli had never seen an indian city before and though this was almost heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid some king had built it long ago on little hill you could still trace stone causeways that led up ruined gates where last splinters of wood hung worn rusted hinges trees had grown into and out of walls ; battlements were tumbled down and decayed and wild creepers hung out of windows of towers on walls in bushy hanging clumps great roofless palace crowned hill and marble of courtyards and fountains was split and stained with red and green and very cobblestones in courtyard where king ’ elephants used live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees from palace you could see rows and rows of roofless houses that made up city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness ; shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in square where four roads met ; pits and dimples at street corners where public wells once stood and shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on their sides monkeys called place their city and pretended despise jungle-people because they lived in forest and yet they never knew what buildings were made for nor how use them they would sit in circles on hall of king ’ council chamber and scratch for fleas and pretend be men ; or they would run in and out of roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old bricks in corner and forget where they had hidden them and fight and cry in scuffling crowds and then break off play up and down terraces of king ’ garden where they would shake rose trees and oranges in sport see fruit and flowers fall they explored all passages and dark tunnels in palace and hundreds of little dark rooms but they never remembered what they had seen and what they had not ; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling each other that they were doing as men did they drank at tanks and made water all muddy and then they fought over it and then they would all rush together in mobs and shout : “ there is no one in jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as bandar-log. ” then all would begin again till they grew tired of city and went back tree-tops hoping jungle-people would notice them mowgli who had been trained under law of jungle did not like or understand this kind of life monkeys dragged him into cold lairs late in afternoon and instead of going sleep as mowgli would have done after long journey they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs one of monkeys made speech and told his companions that mowgli ’ capture marked new thing in history of bandar-log for mowgli was going show them how weave sticks and canes together as protection against rain and cold mowgli picked up some creepers and began work them in and out and monkeys tried imitate ; but in very few minutes they lost interest and began pull their friends ’ tails or jump up and down on all fours coughing “ i wish eat ” said mowgli “ i am stranger in this part of jungle bring food or give leave hunt here. ” twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away bring him nuts and wild pawpaws but they fell fighting on road and it was much trouble go back with what was left of fruit mowgli was sore and angry as well as hungry and he roamed through empty city giving strangers ’ hunting call from time time but no one answered him and mowgli felt that he had reached very bad place indeed “ all that baloo has said about bandar-log is true ” he thought himself “ they have no law no hunting call and no leaders -- nothing but foolish words and little picking thievish hands so if i am starved or killed here it will be all my own fault but i must try return my own jungle baloo will surely beat but that is better than chasing silly rose leaves with bandar-log. ” no sooner had he walked city wall than monkeys pulled him back telling him that he did not know how happy he was and pinching him make him grateful he set his teeth and said nothing but went with shouting monkeys terrace above red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water there was ruined summer-house of white marble in center of terrace built for queens dead hundred years ago domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up underground passage from palace by which queens used enter but walls were made of screens of marble tracery -- beautiful milk-white fretwork set with agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli and as moon came up behind hill it shone through open work casting shadows on ground like black velvet embroidery sore sleepy and hungry as he was mowgli could not help laughing when bandar-log began twenty at time tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were and how foolish he was wish leave them “ we are great we are free we are wonderful we are most wonderful people in all jungle we all say so and so it must be true ” they shouted “ now as you are new listener and can carry our words back jungle-people so that they may notice us in future we will tell you all about our most excellent selves. ” mowgli made no objection and monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on terrace listen their own speakers singing praises of bandar-log and whenever speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together : “ this is true ; we all say so. ” mowgli nodded and blinked and said “ yes ” when they asked him question and his head spun with noise “ tabaqui jackal must have bitten all these people ” he said himself “ and now they have madness certainly this is dewanee madness do they never go sleep now there is cloud coming cover that moon if it were only big enough cloud i might try run away in darkness but i am tired. ” that same cloud was being watched by two good friends in ruined ditch below city wall for bagheera and kaa knowing well how dangerous monkey-people were in large numbers did not wish run any risks monkeys never fight unless they are hundred one and few in jungle care for those odds “ i will go west wall ” kaa whispered “ and come down swiftly with slope of ground in my favor they will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds but -- ” “ i know it ” said bagheera “ would that baloo were here but we must do what we can when that cloud covers moon i shall go terrace they hold some sort of council there over boy. ” “ good hunting ” said kaa grimly and glided away west wall that happened be least ruined of any and big snake was delayed awhile before he could find way up stones cloud hid moon and as mowgli wondered what would come next he heard bagheera ’ light feet on terrace black panther had raced up slope almost without sound and was striking -- he knew better than waste time in biting -- right and left among monkeys who were seated round mowgli in circles fifty and sixty deep there was howl of fright and rage and then as bagheera tripped on rolling kicking bodies beneath him monkey shouted : “ there is only one here kill him kill. ” scuffling mass of monkeys biting scratching tearing and pulling closed over bagheera while five or six laid hold of mowgli dragged him up wall of summerhouse and pushed him through hole of broken dome man-trained boy would have been badly bruised for fall was good fifteen feet but mowgli fell as baloo had taught him fall and landed on his feet “ stay there ” shouted monkeys “ till we have killed thy friends and later we will play with thee -- if poison-people leave thee alive. ” “ we be of one blood ye and i ” said mowgli quickly giving snake ’ call he could hear rustling and hissing in rubbish all round him and gave call second time make sure “ even ssso down hoods all ” said half dozen low voices ( every ruin in india becomes sooner or later dwelling place of snakes and old summerhouse was alive with cobras ) “ stand still little brother for thy feet may do us harm. ” mowgli stood as quietly as he could peering through open work and listening furious din of fight round black panther -- yells and chatterings and scufflings and bagheera ’ deep hoarse cough as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under heaps of his enemies for first time since he was born bagheera was fighting for his life “ baloo must be at hand ; bagheera would not have come alone ” mowgli thought and then he called aloud : “ tank bagheera roll water tanks roll and plunge get water ” bagheera heard and cry that told him mowgli was safe gave him new courage he worked his way desperately inch by inch straight for reservoirs halting in silence then from ruined wall nearest jungle rose up rumbling war-shout of baloo old bear had done his best but he could not come before “ bagheera ” he shouted “ i am here i climb i haste ahuwora stones slip under my feet wait my coming most infamous bandar-log ” he panted up terrace only disappear head in wave of monkeys but he threw himself squarely on his haunches and spreading out his forepaws hugged as many as he could hold and then began hit with regular bat-bat-bat like flipping strokes of paddle wheel crash and splash told mowgli that bagheera had fought his way tank where monkeys could not follow panther lay gasping for breath his head just out of water while monkeys stood three deep on red steps dancing up and down with rage ready spring upon him from all sides if he came out help baloo it was then that bagheera lifted up his dripping chin and in despair gave snake ’ call for protection -- “ we be of one blood ye and i ” -- for he believed that kaa had turned tail at last minute even baloo half smothered under monkeys on edge of terrace could not help chuckling as he heard black panther asking for help kaa had only just worked his way over west wall landing with wrench that dislodged coping stone into ditch he had no intention of losing any advantage of ground and coiled and uncoiled himself once or twice be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order all that while fight with baloo went on and monkeys yelled in tank round bagheera and mang bat flying and fro carried news of great battle over jungle till even hathi wild elephant trumpeted and far away scattered bands of monkey-folk woke and came leaping along tree-roads help their comrades in cold lairs and noise of fight roused all day birds for miles round then kaa came straight quickly and anxious kill fighting strength of python is in driving blow of his head backed by all strength and weight of his body if you can imagine lance or battering ram or hammer weighing nearly half ton driven by cool quiet mind living in handle of it you can roughly imagine what kaa was like when he fought python four or five feet long can knock man down if he hits him fairly in chest and kaa was thirty feet long as you know his first stroke was delivered into heart of crowd round baloo it was sent home with shut mouth in silence and there was no need of second monkeys scattered with cries of -- “ kaa it is kaa run run ” generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by stories their elders told them of kaa night thief who could slip along branches as quietly as moss grows and steal away strongest monkey that ever lived ; of old kaa who could make himself look so like dead branch or rotten stump that wisest were deceived till branch caught them kaa was everything that monkeys feared in jungle for none of them knew limits of his power none of them could look him in face and none had ever come alive out of his hug and so they ran stammering with terror walls and roofs of houses and baloo drew deep breath of relief his fur was much thicker than bagheera ’ but he had suffered sorely in fight then kaa opened his mouth for first time and spoke one long hissing word and far-away monkeys hurrying defense of cold lairs stayed where they were cowering till loaded branches bent and crackled under them monkeys on walls and empty houses stopped their cries and in stillness that fell upon city mowgli heard bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from tank then clamor broke out again monkeys leaped higher up walls they clung around necks of big stone idols and shrieked as they skipped along battlements while mowgli dancing in summerhouse put his eye screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front teeth show his derision and contempt “ get man-cub out of that trap ; i can do no more ” bagheera gasped “ let us take man-cub and go they may attack again. ” “ they will not move till i order them stay you sssso ” kaa hissed and city was silent once more “ i could not come before brother but i think i heard thee call ” -- this was bagheera “ i -- i may have cried out in battle ” bagheera answered “ baloo art thou hurt “ i am not sure that they did not pull into hundred little bearlings ” said baloo gravely shaking one leg after other “ wow i am sore kaa we owe thee i think our lives -- bagheera and i. ” “ no matter where is manling ” “ here in trap i can not climb out ” cried mowgli curve of broken dome was above his head “ take him away he dances like mao peacock he will crush our young ” said cobras inside “ hah ” said kaa with chuckle “ he has friends everywhere this manling stand back manling and hide you poison people i break down wall. ” kaa looked carefully till he found discolored crack in marble tracery showing weak spot made two or three light taps with his head get distance and then lifting up six feet of his body clear of ground sent home half dozen full-power smashing blows nose-first screen-work broke and fell away in cloud of dust and rubbish and mowgli leaped through opening and flung himself between baloo and bagheera -- an arm around each big neck “ art thou hurt ” said baloo hugging him softly “ i am sore hungry and not little bruised but oh they have handled ye grievously my brothers ye bleed. ” “ others also ” said bagheera licking his lips and looking at monkey-dead on terrace and round tank “ it is nothing it is nothing if thou art safe oh my pride of all little frogs ” whimpered baloo “ of that we shall judge later ” said bagheera in dry voice that mowgli did not at all like “ but here is kaa whom we owe battle and thou owest thy life thank him according our customs mowgli. ” mowgli turned and saw great python ’ head swaying foot above his own “ so this is manling ” said kaa “ very soft is his skin and he is not unlike bandar-log have care manling that i do not mistake thee for monkey some twilight when i have newly changed my coat. ” “ we be one blood thou and i ” mowgli answered “ i take my life from thee tonight my kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry kaa. ” “ all thanks little brother ” said kaa though his eyes twinkled “ and what may so bold hunter kill i ask that i may follow when next he goes abroad. ” “ i kill nothing -- i am little -- but i drive goats toward such as can use them when thou art empty come and see if i speak truth i have some skill in these [ he held out his hands ] and if ever thou art in trap i may pay debt which i owe thee bagheera and baloo here good hunting ye all my masters. ” “ well said ” growled baloo for mowgli had returned thanks very prettily python dropped his head lightly for minute on mowgli ’ shoulder “ brave heart and courteous tongue ” said he “ they shall carry thee far through jungle manling but now go hence quickly with thy friends go and sleep for moon sets and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see. ” moon was sinking behind hills and lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things baloo went down tank for drink and bagheera began put his fur in order as kaa glided out into center of terrace and brought his jaws together with ringing snap that drew all monkeys ’ eyes upon him “ moon sets ” he said “ is there yet light enough see ” from walls came moan like wind in tree-tops -- “ we see kaa. ” “ good begins now dance -- dance of hunger of kaa sit still and watch. ” he turned twice or thrice in big circle weaving his head from right left then he began making loops and figures of eight with his body and soft oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided figures and coiled mounds never resting never hurrying and never stopping his low humming song it grew darker and darker till at last dragging shifting coils disappeared but they could hear rustle of scales baloo and bagheera stood still as stone growling in their throats their neck hair bristling and mowgli watched and wondered “ bandar-log ” said voice of kaa at last “ can ye stir foot or hand without my order speak ” “ without thy order we can not stir foot or hand kaa ” “ good come all one pace nearer me. ” lines of monkeys swayed forward helplessly and baloo and bagheera took one stiff step forward with them “ nearer ” hissed kaa and they all moved again mowgli laid his hands on baloo and bagheera get them away and two great beasts started as though they had been waked from dream “ keep thy hand on my shoulder ” bagheera whispered “ keep it there or i must go back -- must go back kaa aah ” “ it is only old kaa making circles on dust ” said mowgli “ let us go. ” and three slipped off through gap in walls jungle “ whoof ” said baloo when he stood under still trees again “ never more will i make an ally of kaa ” and he shook himself all over “ he knows more than we ” said bagheera trembling “ in little time had i stayed i should have walked down his throat. ” “ many will walk by that road before moon rises again ” said baloo “ he will have good hunting -- after his own fashion. ” “ but what was meaning of it all ” said mowgli who did not know anything of python ’ powers of fascination “ i saw no more than big snake making foolish circles till dark came and his nose was all sore ho ho ” “ mowgli ” said bagheera angrily “ his nose was sore on thy account as my ears and sides and paws and baloo ’ neck and shoulders are bitten on thy account neither baloo nor bagheera will be able hunt with pleasure for many days. ” “ it is nothing ” said baloo ; “ we have man-cub again. ” “ true but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in good hunting in wounds in hair -- i am half plucked along my back -- and last of all in honor for remember mowgli i who am black panther was forced call upon kaa for protection and baloo and i were both made stupid as little birds by hunger dance all this man-cub came of thy playing with bandar-log. ” “ true it is true ” said mowgli sorrowfully “ i am an evil man-cub and my stomach is sad in me. ” “ mf what says law of jungle baloo ” baloo did not wish bring mowgli into any more trouble but he could not tamper with law so he mumbled : “ sorrow never stays punishment but remember bagheera he is very little. ” “ i will remember but he has done mischief and blows must be dealt now mowgli hast thou anything say ” “ nothing i did wrong baloo and thou are wounded it is just. ” bagheera gave him half dozen love-taps from panther ’ point of view ( they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs ) but for seven-year-old boy they amounted as severe beating as you could wish avoid when it was all over mowgli sneezed and picked himself up without word “ now ” said bagheera “ jump on my back little brother and we will go home. ” one of beauties of jungle law is that punishment settles all scores there is no nagging afterward mowgli laid his head down on bagheera ’ back and slept so deeply that he never waked when he was put down in home-cave road-song of bandar-log here we go in flung festoon half-way up jealous moon don ’ you envy our pranceful bands don ’ you wish you had extra hands wouldn ’ you like if your tails were -- so -- curved in shape of cupid ’ bow now you ’ angry but -- never mind brother thy tail hangs down behind here we sit in branchy row thinking of beautiful things we know ; dreaming of deeds that we mean do all complete in minute or two -- something noble and wise and good done by merely wishing we could we ’ forgotten but -- never mind brother thy tail hangs down behind all talk we ever have heard uttered by bat or beast or bird -- hide or fin or scale or feather -- jabber it quickly and all together excellent wonderful once again now we are talking just like men let ’ pretend we are ... never mind brother thy tail hangs down behind this is way of monkey-kind then join our leaping lines that scumfish through pines that rocket by where light and high wild grape swings by rubbish in our wake and noble noise we make be sure be sure we ’ going do some splendid things “ tiger tiger ” what of hunting hunter bold brother watch was long and cold what of quarry ye went kill brother he crops in jungle still where is power that made your pride brother it ebbs from my flank and side where is haste that ye hurry by brother i go my lair -- die now we must go back first tale when mowgli left wolf ’ cave after fight with pack at council rock he went down plowed lands where villagers lived but he would not stop there because it was near jungle and he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at council so he hurried on keeping rough road that ran down valley and followed it at steady jog-trot for nearly twenty miles till he came country that he did not know valley opened out into great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines at one end stood little village and at other thick jungle came down in sweep grazing-grounds and stopped there as though it had been cut off with hoe all over plain cattle and buffaloes were grazing and when little boys in charge of herds saw mowgli they shouted and ran away and yellow pariah dogs that hang about every indian village barked mowgli walked on for he was feeling hungry and when he came village gate he saw big thorn-bush that was drawn up before gate at twilight pushed one side “ umph ” he said for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things eat “ so men are afraid of people of jungle here also. ” he sat down by gate and when man came out he stood up opened his mouth and pointed down it show that he wanted food man stared and ran back up one street of village shouting for priest who was big fat man dressed in white with red and yellow mark on his forehead priest came gate and with him at least hundred people who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at mowgli “ they have no manners these men folk ” said mowgli himself “ only gray ape would behave as they do. ” so he threw back his long hair and frowned at crowd “ what is there be afraid of ” said priest “ look at marks on his arms and legs they are bites of wolves he is but wolf-child run away from jungle. ” of course in playing together cubs had often nipped mowgli harder than they intended and there were white scars all over his arms and legs but he would have been last person in world call these bites for he knew what real biting meant “ arre arre ” said two or three women together “ be bitten by wolves poor child he is handsome boy he has eyes like red fire by my honor messua he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by tiger. ” “ let look ” said woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles and she peered at mowgli under palm of her hand “ indeed he is not he is thinner but he has very look of my boy. ” priest was clever man and he knew that messua was wife richest villager in place so he looked up at sky for minute and said solemnly : “ what jungle has taken jungle has restored take boy into thy house my sister and forget not honor priest who sees so far into lives of men. ” “ by bull that bought ” said mowgli himself “ but all this talking is like another looking-over by pack well if i am man man i must become. ” crowd parted as woman beckoned mowgli her hut where there was red lacquered bedstead great earthen grain chest with funny raised patterns on it half dozen copper cooking pots an image of hindu god in little alcove and on wall real looking glass such as they sell at country fairs she gave him long drink of milk and some bread and then she laid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes ; for she thought perhaps that he might be her real son come back from jungle where tiger had taken him so she said “ nathoo nathoo ” mowgli did not show that he knew name “ dost thou not remember day when i gave thee thy new shoes ” she touched his foot and it was almost as hard as horn “ no ” she said sorrowfully “ those feet have never worn shoes but thou art very like my nathoo and thou shalt be my son. ” mowgli was uneasy because he had never been under roof before but as he looked at thatch he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted get away and that window had no fastenings “ what is good of man ” he said himself at last “ if he does not understand man ’ talk now i am as silly and dumb as man would be with us in jungle i must speak their talk. ” it was not for fun that he had learned while he was with wolves imitate challenge of bucks in jungle and grunt of little wild pig so as soon as messua pronounced word mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly and before dark he had learned names of many things in hut there was difficulty at bedtime because mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like panther trap as that hut and when they shut door he went through window “ give him his will ” said messua ’ husband “ remember he can never till now have slept on bed if he is indeed sent in place of our son he will not run away. ” so mowgli stretched himself in some long clean grass at edge of field but before he had closed his eyes soft gray nose poked him under chin “ phew ” said gray brother ( he was eldest of mother wolf ’ cubs ) “ this is poor reward for following thee twenty miles thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle -- altogether like man already wake little brother ; i bring news. ” “ are all well in jungle ” said mowgli hugging him “ all except wolves that were burned with red flower now listen shere khan has gone away hunt far off till his coat grows again for he is badly singed when he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in waingunga. ” “ there are two words that i also have made little promise but news is always good i am tired to-night -- very tired with new things gray brother -- but bring news always. ” “ thou wilt not forget that thou art wolf men will not make thee forget ” said gray brother anxiously “ never i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave but also i will always remember that i have been cast out of pack. ” “ and that thou mayest be cast out of another pack men are only men little brother and their talk is like talk of frogs in pond when i come down here again i will wait for thee in bamboos at edge of grazing-ground. ” for three months after that night mowgli hardly ever left village gate he was so busy learning ways and customs of men first he had wear cloth round him which annoyed him horribly ; and then he had learn about money which he did not in least understand and about plowing of which he did not see use then little children in village made him very angry luckily law of jungle had taught him keep his temper for in jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper ; but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites or because he mispronounced some word only knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two he did not know his own strength in least in jungle he knew he was weak compared with beasts but in village people said that he was as strong as bull and mowgli had not faintest idea of difference that caste makes between man and man when potter ’ donkey slipped in clay pit mowgli hauled it out by tail and helped stack pots for their journey market at khanhiwara that was very shocking for potter is low-caste man and his donkey is worse when priest scolded him mowgli threatened put him on donkey and priest told messua ’ husband that mowgli had better be set work as soon as possible ; and village head-man told mowgli that he would have go out with buffaloes next day and herd them while they grazed no one was more pleased than mowgli ; and that night because he had been appointed servant of village as it were he went off circle that met every evening on masonry platform under great fig-tree it was village club and head-man and watchman and barber who knew all gossip of village and old buldeo village hunter who had tower musket met and smoked monkeys sat and talked in upper branches and there was hole under platform where cobra lived and he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred ; and old men sat around tree and talked and pulled at big huqas ( water-pipes ) till far into night they told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts ; and buldeo told even more wonderful ones of ways of beasts in jungle till eyes of children sitting outside circle bulged out of their heads most of tales were about animals for jungle was always at their door deer and wild pig grubbed up their crops and now and again tiger carried off man at twilight within sight of village gates mowgli who naturally knew something about what they were talking of had cover his face not show that he was laughing while buldeo tower musket across his knees climbed on from one wonderful story another and mowgli ’ shoulders shook buldeo was explaining how tiger that had carried away messua ’ son was ghost-tiger and his body was inhabited by ghost of wicked old money-lender who had died some years ago “ and i know that this is true ” he said “ because purun dass always limped from blow that he got in riot when his account books were burned and tiger that i speak of he limps for tracks of his pads are unequal. ” “ true true that must be truth ” said gray-beards nodding together “ are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk ” said mowgli “ that tiger limps because he was born lame as everyone knows talk of soul of money-lender in beast that never had courage of jackal is child ’ talk. ” buldeo was speechless with surprise for moment and head-man stared “ oho it is jungle brat is it ” said buldeo “ if thou art so wise better bring his hide khanhiwara for government has set hundred rupees on his life better still talk not when thy elders speak. ” mowgli rose go “ all evening i have lain here listening ” he called back over his shoulder “ and except once or twice buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning jungle which is at his very doors how then shall i believe tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen ” “ it is full time that boy went herding ” said head-man while buldeo puffed and snorted at mowgli ’ impertinence custom of most indian villages is for few boys take cattle and buffaloes out graze in early morning and bring them back at night very cattle that would trample white man death allow themselves be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up their noses so long as boys keep with herds they are safe for not even tiger will charge mob of cattle but if they straggle pick flowers or hunt lizards they are sometimes carried off mowgli went through village street in dawn sitting on back of rama great herd bull slaty-blue buffaloes with their long backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes rose out their byres one by one and followed him and mowgli made it very clear children with him that he was master he beat buffaloes with long polished bamboo and told kamya one of boys graze cattle by themselves while he went on with buffaloes and be very careful not stray away from herd an indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little ravines among which herds scatter and disappear buffaloes generally keep pools and muddy places where they lie wallowing or basking in warm mud for hours mowgli drove them on edge of plain where waingunga came out of jungle ; then he dropped from rama ’ neck trotted off bamboo clump and found gray brother “ ah ” said gray brother “ i have waited here very many days what is meaning of this cattle-herding work ” “ it is an order ” said mowgli “ i am village herd for while what news of shere khan ” “ he has come back this country and has waited here long time for thee now he has gone off again for game is scarce but he means kill thee. ” “ very good ” said mowgli “ so long as he is away do thou or one of four brothers sit on that rock so that i can see thee as i come out of village when he comes back wait for in ravine by dhak tree in center of plain we need not walk into shere khan ’ mouth. ” then mowgli picked out shady place and lay down and slept while buffaloes grazed round him herding in india is one of laziest things in world cattle move and crunch and lie down and move on again and they do not even low they only grunt and buffaloes very seldom say anything but get down into muddy pools one after another and work their way into mud till only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above surface and then they lie like logs sun makes rocks dance in heat and herd children hear one kite ( never any more ) whistling almost out of sight overhead and they know that if they died or cow died that kite would sweep down and next kite miles away would see him drop and follow and next and next and almost before they were dead there would be score of hungry kites come out of nowhere then they sleep and wake and sleep again and weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them ; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight ; or string necklace of red and black jungle nuts ; or watch lizard basking on rock or snake hunting frog near wallows then they sing long long songs with odd native quavers at end of them and day seems longer than most people ’ whole lives and perhaps they make mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes and put reeds into men ’ hands and pretend that they are kings and figures are their armies or that they are gods be worshiped then evening comes and children call and buffaloes lumber up out of sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after other and they all string across gray plain back twinkling village lights day after day mowgli would lead buffaloes out their wallows and day after day he would see gray brother ’ back mile and half away across plain ( so he knew that shere khan had not come back ) and day after day he would lie on grass listening noises round him and dreaming of old days in jungle if shere khan had made false step with his lame paw up in jungles by waingunga mowgli would have heard him in those long still mornings at last day came when he did not see gray brother at signal place and he laughed and headed buffaloes for ravine by dhk tree which was all covered with golden-red flowers there sat gray brother every bristle on his back lifted “ he has hidden for month throw thee off thy guard he crossed ranges last night with tabaqui hot-foot on thy trail ” said wolf panting mowgli frowned “ i am not afraid of shere khan but tabaqui is very cunning. ” “ have no fear ” said gray brother licking his lips little “ i met tabaqui in dawn now he is telling all his wisdom kites but he told everything before i broke his back shere khan ’ plan is wait for thee at village gate this evening -- for thee and for no one else he is lying up now in big dry ravine of waingunga. ” “ has he eaten today or does he hunt empty ” said mowgli for answer meant life and death him “ he killed at dawn -- pig -- and he has drunk remember shere khan could never fast even for sake of revenge. ” “ oh fool fool what cub ’ cub it is eaten and drunk and he thinks that i shall wait till he has slept now where does he lie up if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies these buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him and i can not speak their language can we get behind his track so that they may smell it ” “ he swam far down waingunga cut that off ” said gray brother “ tabaqui told him that i know he would never have thought of it alone. ” mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth thinking “ big ravine of waingunga that opens out on plain not half mile from here i can take herd round through jungle head of ravine and then sweep down -- but he would slink out at foot we must block that end gray brother canst thou cut herd in two for ” “ not i perhaps -- but i have brought wise helper. ” gray brother trotted off and dropped into hole then there lifted up huge gray head that mowgli knew well and hot air was filled with most desolate cry of all jungle -- hunting howl of wolf at midday “ akela akela ” said mowgli clapping his hands “ i might have known that thou wouldst not forget we have big work in hand cut herd in two akela keep cows and calves together and bulls and plow buffaloes by themselves. ” two wolves ran ladies ’ -chain fashion in and out of herd which snorted and threw up its head and separated into two clumps in one cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in center and glared and pawed ready if wolf would only stay still charge down and trample life out of him in other bulls and young bulls snorted and stamped but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous for they had no calves protect no six men could have divided herd so neatly “ what orders ” panted akela “ they are trying join again. ” mowgli slipped on rama ’ back “ drive bulls away left akela gray brother when we are gone hold cows together and drive them into foot of ravine. ” “ how far ” said gray brother panting and snapping “ till sides are higher than shere khan can jump ” shouted mowgli “ keep them there till we come down. ” bulls swept off as akela bayed and gray brother stopped in front of cows they charged down on him and he ran just before them foot of ravine as akela drove bulls far left “ well done another charge and they are fairly started careful now -- careful akela snap much and bulls will charge hujah this is wilder work than driving black-buck didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly ” mowgli called “ i have -- have hunted these in my time ” gasped akela in dust “ shall i turn them into jungle ” “ ay turn swiftly turn them rama is mad with rage oh if i could only tell him what i need of him to-day. ” bulls were turned right this time and crashed into standing thicket other herd children watching with cattle half mile away hurried village as fast as their legs could carry them crying that buffaloes had gone mad and run away but mowgli ’ plan was simple enough all he wanted do was make big circle uphill and get at head of ravine and then take bulls down it and catch shere khan between bulls and cows ; for he knew that after meal and full drink shere khan would not be in any condition fight or clamber up sides of ravine he was soothing buffaloes now by voice and akela had dropped far rear only whimpering once or twice hurry rear-guard it was long long circle for they did not wish get near ravine and give shere khan warning at last mowgli rounded up bewildered herd at head of ravine on grassy patch that sloped steeply down ravine itself from that height you could see across tops of trees down plain below ; but what mowgli looked at was sides of ravine and he saw with great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down while vines and creepers that hung over them would give no foothold tiger who wanted get out “ let them breathe akela ” he said holding up his hand “ they have not winded him yet let them breathe i must tell shere khan who comes we have him in trap. ” he put his hands his mouth and shouted down ravine -- it was almost like shouting down tunnel -- and echoes jumped from rock rock after long time there came back drawling sleepy snarl of full-fed tiger just wakened “ who calls ” said shere khan and splendid peacock fluttered up out of ravine screeching “ i mowgli cattle thief it is time come council rock down -- hurry them down akela down rama down ” herd paused for an instant at edge of slope but akela gave tongue in full hunting-yell and they pitched over one after other just as steamers shoot rapids sand and stones spurting up round them once started there was no chance of stopping and before they were fairly in bed of ravine rama winded shere khan and bellowed “ ha ha ” said mowgli on his back “ now thou knowest ” and torrent of black horns foaming muzzles and staring eyes whirled down ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime ; weaker buffaloes being shouldered out sides of ravine where they tore through creepers they knew what business was before them -- terrible charge of buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope stand shere khan heard thunder of their hoofs picked himself up and lumbered down ravine looking from side side for some way of escape but walls of ravine were straight and he had hold on heavy with his dinner and his drink willing do anything rather than fight herd splashed through pool he had just left bellowing till narrow cut rang mowgli heard an answering bellow from foot of ravine saw shere khan turn ( tiger knew if worst came worst it was better meet bulls than cows with their calves ) and then rama tripped stumbled and went on again over something soft and with bulls at his heels crashed full into other herd while weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by shock of meeting that charge carried both herds out into plain goring and stamping and snorting mowgli watched his time and slipped off rama ’ neck laying about him right and left with his stick “ quick akela break them up scatter them or they will be fighting one another drive them away akela hai rama hai hai hai my children softly now softly it is all over. ” akela and gray brother ran and fro nipping buffaloes ’ legs and though herd wheeled once charge up ravine again mowgli managed turn rama and others followed him wallows shere khan needed no more trampling he was dead and kites were coming for him already “ brothers that was dog ’ death ” said mowgli feeling for knife he always carried in sheath round his neck now that he lived with men “ but he would never have shown fight his hide will look well on council rock we must get work swiftly. ” boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning ten-foot tiger alone but mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal ’ skin is fitted on and how it can be taken off but it was hard work and mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour while wolves lolled out their tongues or came forward and tugged as he ordered them presently hand fell on his shoulder and looking up he saw buldeo with tower musket children had told village about buffalo stampede and buldeo went out angrily only anxious correct mowgli for not taking better care of herd wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw man coming “ what is this folly ” said buldeo angrily “ think that thou canst skin tiger where did buffaloes kill him it is lame tiger and there is hundred rupees on his head well well we will overlook thy letting herd run off and perhaps i will give thee one of rupees of reward when i have taken skin khanhiwara. ” he fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel and stooped down singe shere khan ’ whiskers most native hunters always singe tiger ’ whiskers prevent his ghost from haunting them “ hum ” said mowgli half himself as he ripped back skin of forepaw “ so thou wilt take hide khanhiwara for reward and perhaps give one rupee now it is in my mind that i need skin for my own use heh old man take away that fire ” “ what talk is this chief hunter of village thy luck and stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee this kill tiger has just fed or he would have gone twenty miles by this time thou canst not even skin him properly little beggar brat and forsooth i buldeo must be told not singe his whiskers mowgli i will not give thee one anna of reward but only very big beating leave carcass ” “ by bull that bought ” said mowgli who was trying get at shoulder “ must i stay babbling an old ape all noon here akela this man plagues me. ” buldeo who was still stooping over shere khan ’ head found himself sprawling on grass with gray wolf standing over him while mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all india “ ye-es ” he said between his teeth “ thou art altogether right buldeo thou wilt never give one anna of reward there is an old war between this lame tiger and myself -- very old war and -- i have won. ” do buldeo justice if he had been ten years younger he would have taken his chance with akela had he met wolf in woods but wolf who obeyed orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating tigers was not common animal it was sorcery magic of worst kind thought buldeo and he wondered whether amulet round his neck would protect him he lay as still as still expecting every minute see mowgli turn into tiger “ maharaj great king ” he said at last in husky whisper “ yes ” said mowgli without turning his head chuckling little “ i am an old man i did not know that thou wast anything more than herdsboy may i rise up and go away or will thy servant tear pieces ” “ go and peace go with thee only another time do not meddle with my game let him go akela. ” buldeo hobbled away village as fast as he could looking back over his shoulder in case mowgli should change into something terrible when he got village he told tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made priest look very grave mowgli went on with his work but it was nearly twilight before he and wolves had drawn great gay skin clear of body “ now we must hide this and take buffaloes home help herd them akela. ” herd rounded up in misty twilight and when they got near village mowgli saw lights and heard conches and bells in temple blowing and banging half village seemed be waiting for him by gate “ that is because i have killed shere khan ” he said himself but shower of stones whistled about his ears and villagers shouted : “ sorcerer wolf ’ brat jungle demon go away get hence quickly or priest will turn thee into wolf again shoot buldeo shoot ” old tower musket went off with bang and young buffalo bellowed in pain “ more sorcery ” shouted villagers “ he can turn bullets buldeo that was thy buffalo. ” “ now what is this ” said mowgli bewildered as stones flew thicker “ they are not unlike pack these brothers of thine ” said akela sitting down composedly “ it is in my head that if bullets mean anything they would cast thee out. ” “ wolf wolf ’ cub go away ” shouted priest waving sprig of sacred tulsi plant “ again last time it was because i was man this time it is because i am wolf let us go akela. ” woman -- it was messua -- ran across herd and cried : “ oh my son my son they say thou art sorcerer who can turn himself into beast at will i do not believe but go away or they will kill thee buldeo says thou art wizard but i know thou hast avenged nathoo ’ death. ” “ come back messua ” shouted crowd “ come back or we will stone thee. ” mowgli laughed little short ugly laugh for stone had hit him in mouth “ run back messua this is one of foolish tales they tell under big tree at dusk i have at least paid for thy son ’ life farewell ; and run quickly for i shall send herd in more swiftly than their brickbats i am no wizard messua farewell ” “ now once more akela ” he cried “ bring herd in. ” buffaloes were anxious enough get village they hardly needed akela ’ yell but charged through gate like whirlwind scattering crowd right and left “ keep count ” shouted mowgli scornfully “ it may be that i have stolen one of them keep count for i will do your herding no more fare you well children of men and thank messua that i do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street. ” he turned on his heel and walked away with lone wolf and as he looked up at stars he felt happy “ no more sleeping in traps for akela let us get shere khan ’ skin and go away no we will not hurt village for messua was kind me. ” when moon rose over plain making it look all milky horrified villagers saw mowgli with two wolves at his heels and bundle on his head trotting across at steady wolf ’ trot that eats up long miles like fire then they banged temple bells and blew conches louder than ever and messua cried and buldeo embroidered story of his adventures in jungle till he ended by saying that akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like man moon was just going down when mowgli and two wolves came hill of council rock and they stopped at mother wolf ’ cave “ they have cast out from man-pack mother ” shouted mowgli “ but i come with hide of shere khan keep my word. ” mother wolf walked stiffly from cave with cubs behind her and her eyes glowed as she saw skin “ i told him on that day when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave hunting for thy life little frog -- i told him that hunter would be hunted it is well done. ” “ little brother it is well done ” said deep voice in thicket “ we were lonely in jungle without thee ” and bagheera came running mowgli ’ bare feet they clambered up council rock together and mowgli spread skin out on flat stone where akela used sit and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo and akela lay down upon it and called old call council “ look -- look well wolves ” exactly as he had called when mowgli was first brought there ever since akela had been deposed pack had been without leader hunting and fighting at their own pleasure but they answered call from habit ; and some of them were lame from traps they had fallen into and some limped from shot wounds and some were mangy from eating bad food and many were missing but they came council rock all that were left of them and saw shere khan ’ striped hide on rock and huge claws dangling at end of empty dangling feet it was then that mowgli made up song that came up into his throat all by itself and he shouted it aloud leaping up and down on rattling skin and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left while gray brother and akela howled between verses “ look well wolves have i kept my word ” said mowgli and wolves bayed “ yes ” and one tattered wolf howled : “ lead us again akela lead us again man-cub for we be sick of this lawlessness and we would be free people once more. ” “ nay ” purred bagheera “ that may not be when ye are full-fed madness may come upon you again not for nothing are ye called free people ye fought for freedom and it is yours eat it wolves. ” “ man-pack and wolf-pack have cast out ” said mowgli “ now i will hunt alone in jungle. ” “ and we will hunt with thee ” said four cubs so mowgli went away and hunted with four cubs in jungle from that day on but he was not always alone because years afterward he became man and married but that is story for grown-ups mowgli ’ song that he sang at council rock when he danced on shere khan ’ hide song of mowgli -- i mowgli am singing let jungle listen things i have done shere khan said he would kill -- would kill at gates in twilight he would kill mowgli frog he ate and he drank drink deep shere khan for when wilt thou drink again sleep and dream of kill i am alone on grazing-grounds gray brother come come lone wolf for there is big game afoot bring up great bull buffaloes blue-skinned herd bulls with angry eyes drive them and fro as i order sleepest thou still shere khan wake oh wake here come i and bulls are behind rama king of

under my feet all jungle knows that i have killed shere khan look -- look well wolves ahae my heart is heavy with things that i do not understand white seal oh hush thee my baby night is behind us and black are waters that sparkled so green moon ’ er combers looks downward find us at rest in hollows that rustle between where billow meets billow then soft be thy pillow ah weary wee flipperling curl at thy ease storm shall not wake thee nor shark overtake thee asleep in arms of slow-swinging seas seal lullaby all these things happened several years ago at place called novastoshnah or north east point on island of st. paul away and away in bering sea limmershin winter wren told tale when he was blown on rigging of steamer going japan and i took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for couple of days till he was fit fly back st. paul ’ again limmershin is very quaint little bird but he knows how tell truth nobody comes novastoshnah except on business and only people who have regular business there are seals they come in summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of cold gray sea for novastoshnah beach has finest accommodation for seals of any place in all world sea catch knew that and every spring would swim from whatever place he happened be in -- would swim like torpedo-boat straight for novastoshnah and spend month fighting with his companions for good place on rocks as close sea as possible sea catch was fifteen years old huge gray fur seal with almost mane on his shoulders and long wicked dog teeth when he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of ground and his weight if anyone had been bold enough weigh him was nearly seven hundred pounds he was scarred all over with marks of savage fights but he was always ready for just one fight more he would put his head on one side as though he were afraid look his enemy in face ; then he would shoot it out like lightning and when big teeth were firmly fixed on other seal ’ neck other seal might get away if he could but sea catch would not help him yet sea catch never chased beaten seal for that was against rules of beach he only wanted room by sea for his nursery but as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for same thing each spring whistling bellowing roaring and blowing on beach was something frightful from little hill called hutchinson ’ hill you could look over three and half miles of ground covered with fighting seals ; and surf was dotted all over with heads of seals hurrying land and begin their share of fighting they fought in breakers they fought in sand and they fought on smooth-worn basalt rocks of nurseries for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men their wives never came island until late in may or early in june for they did not care be torn pieces ; and young two- three- and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half mile through ranks of fighters and played about on sand dunes in droves and legions and rubbed off every single green thing that grew they were called holluschickie -- bachelors -- and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at novastoshnah alone sea catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when matkah his soft sleek gentle-eyed wife came up out of sea and he caught her by scruff of neck and dumped her down on his reservation saying gruffly : “ late as usual where have you been ” it was not fashion for sea catch eat anything during four months he stayed on beaches and so his temper was generally bad matkah knew better than answer back she looked round and cooed : “ how thoughtful of you you ’ taken old place again. ” “ i should think i had ” said sea catch “ look at ” he was scratched and bleeding in twenty places ; one eye was almost out and his sides were torn ribbons “ oh you men you men ” matkah said fanning herself with her hind flipper “ why can ’ you be sensible and settle your places quietly you look as though you had been fighting with killer whale. ” “ i haven ’ been doing anything but fight since middle of may beach is disgracefully crowded this season i ’ met at least hundred seals from lukannon beach house hunting why can ’ people stay where they belong ” “ i ’ often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at otter island instead of this crowded place ” said matkah “ bah only holluschickie go otter island if we went there they would say we were afraid we must preserve appearances my dear. ” sea catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended go sleep for few minutes but all time he was keeping sharp lookout for fight now that all seals and their wives were on land you could hear their clamor miles out sea above loudest gales at lowest counting there were over million seals on beach -- old seals mother seals tiny babies and holluschickie fighting scuffling bleating crawling and playing together -- going down sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments lying over every foot of ground as far as eye could reach and skirmishing about in brigades through fog it is nearly always foggy at novastoshnah except when sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rainbow-colored for little while kotick matkah ’ baby was born in middle of that confusion and he was all head and shoulders with pale watery blue eyes as tiny seals must be but there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely “ sea catch ” she said at last “ our baby ’ going be white ” “ empty clam-shells and dry seaweed ” snorted sea catch “ there never has been such thing in world as white seal. ” “ i can ’ help that ” said matkah ; “ there ’ going be now. ” and she sang low crooning seal song that all mother seals sing their babies : you ’ swim till you ’ six weeks old or your head will be sunk by your heels ; and summer gales and killer whales are bad for baby seals are bad for baby seals dear rat as bad as bad can be ; but splash and grow strong and you can ’ be wrong child of open sea of course little fellow did not understand words at first he paddled and scrambled about by his mother ’ side and learned scuffle out of way when his father was fighting with another seal and two rolled and roared up and down slippery rocks matkah used go sea get things eat and baby was fed only once in two days but then he ate all he could and throve upon it first thing he did was crawl inland and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age and they played together like puppies went sleep on clean sand and played again old people in nurseries took no notice of them and holluschickie kept their own grounds and babies had beautiful playtime when matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight their playground and call as sheep calls for lamb and wait until she heard kotick bleat then she would take straightest of straight lines in his direction striking out with her fore flippers and knocking youngsters head over heels right and left there were always few hundred mothers hunting for their children through playgrounds and babies were kept lively but as matkah told kotick “ so long as you don ’ lie in muddy water and get mange or rub hard sand into cut or scratch and so long as you never go swimming when there is heavy sea nothing will hurt you here. ” little seals can no more swim than little children but they are unhappy till they learn first time that kotick went down sea wave carried him out beyond his depth and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in song and if next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned after that he learned lie in beach pool and let wash of waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt he was two weeks learning use his flippers ; and all that while he floundered in and out of water and coughed and grunted and crawled up beach and took catnaps on sand and went back again until at last he found that he truly belonged water then you can imagine times that he had with his companions ducking under rollers ; or coming in on top of comber and landing with swash and splutter as big wave went whirling far up beach ; or standing up on his tail and scratching his head as old people did ; or playing “ i ’ king of castle ” on slippery weedy rocks that just stuck out of wash. now and then he would see thin fin like big shark ’ fin drifting along close shore and he knew that that was killer whale grampus who eats young seals when he can get them ; and kotick would head for beach like an arrow and fin would jig off slowly as if it were looking for nothing at all late in october seals began leave st. paul ’ for deep sea by families and tribes and there was no more fighting over nurseries and holluschickie played anywhere they liked “ next year ” said matkah kotick “ you will be holluschickie ; but this year you must learn how catch fish. ” they set out together across pacific and matkah showed kotick how sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of water no cradle is so comfortable as long rocking swell of pacific when kotick felt his skin tingle all over matkah told him he was learning “ feel of water ” and that tingly prickly feelings meant bad weather coming and he must swim hard and get away “ in little time ” she said “ you ’ know where swim but just now we ’ follow sea pig porpoise for he is very wise. ” school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through water and little kotick followed them as fast as he could “ how do you know where go ” he panted leader of school rolled his white eye and ducked under “ my tail tingles youngster ” he said “ that means there ’ gale behind come along when you ’ south of sticky water [ he meant equator ] and your tail tingles that means there ’ gale in front of you and you must head north come along water feels bad here. ” this was one of very many things that kotick learned and he was always learning matkah taught him follow cod and halibut along under-sea banks and wrench rockling out of his hole among weeds ; how skirt wrecks lying hundred fathoms below water and dart like rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as fishes ran ; how dance on top of waves when lightning was racing all over sky and wave his flipper politely stumpy-tailed albatross and man-of-war hawk as they went down wind ; how jump three or four feet clear of water like dolphin flippers close side and tail curved ; leave flying fish alone because they are all bony ; take shoulder-piece out of cod at full speed ten fathoms deep and never stop and look at boat or ship but particularly row-boat at end of six months what kotick did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth knowing and all that time he never set flipper on dry ground one day however as he was lying half asleep in warm water somewhere off island of juan fernandez he felt faint and lazy all over just as human people do when spring is in their legs and he remembered good firm beaches of novastoshnah seven thousand miles away games his companions played smell of seaweed seal roar and fighting that very minute he turned north swimming steadily and as he went on he met scores of his mates all bound for same place and they said : “ greeting kotick this year we are all holluschickie and we can dance fire-dance in breakers off lukannon and play on new grass but where did you get that coat ” kotick ’ fur was almost pure white now and though he felt very proud of it he only said “ swim quickly my bones are aching for land. ” and so they all came beaches where they had been born and heard old seals their fathers fighting in rolling mist that night kotick danced fire-dance with yearling seals sea is full of fire on summer nights all way down from novastoshnah lukannon and each seal leaves wake like burning oil behind him and flaming flash when he jumps and waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls then they went inland holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea they talked about pacific as boys would talk about wood that they had been nutting in and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such chart of that ocean as never was three- and four-year-old holluschickie romped down from hutchinson ’ hill crying : “ out of way youngsters sea is deep and you don ’ know all that ’ in it yet wait till you ’ rounded horn hi you yearling where did you get that white coat ” “ i ’ get it ” said kotick “ it grew. ” and just as he was going roll speaker over couple of black-haired men with flat red faces came from behind sand dune and kotick who had never seen man before coughed and lowered his head holluschickie just bundled off few yards and sat staring stupidly men were no less than kerick booterin chief of seal-hunters on island and patalamon his son they came from little village not half mile from sea nurseries and they were deciding what seals they would drive up killing pens -- for seals were driven just like sheep -- be turned into seal-skin jackets later on “ ho ” said patalamon “ look there ’ white seal ” kerick booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke for he was an aleut and aleuts are not clean people then he began mutter prayer “ don ’ touch him patalamon there has never been white seal since -- since i was born perhaps it is old zaharrof ’ ghost he was lost last year in big gale. ” “ i ’ not going near him ” said patalamon “ he ’ unlucky do you really think he is old zaharrof come back i owe him for some gulls ’ eggs. ” “ don ’ look at him ” said kerick “ head off that drove of four-year-olds men ought skin two hundred to-day but it ’ beginning of season and they are new work hundred will do quick ” patalamon rattled pair of seal ’ shoulder bones in front of herd of holluschickie and they stopped dead puffing and blowing then he stepped near and seals began move and kerick headed them inland and they never tried get back their companions hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven but they went on playing just same kotick was only one who asked questions and none of his companions could tell him anything except that men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year “ i am going follow ” he said and his eyes nearly popped out of his head as he shuffled along in wake of herd “ white seal is coming after us ” cried patalamon “ that ’ first time seal has ever come killing-grounds alone. ” “ hsh don ’ look behind you ” said kerick “ it is zaharrof ’ ghost i must speak priest about this. ” distance killing-grounds was only half mile but it took an hour cover because if seals went fast kerick knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned so they went on very slowly past sea lion ’ neck past webster house till they came salt house just beyond sight of seals on beach kotick followed panting and wondering he thought that he was at world ’ end but roar of seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as roar of train in tunnel then kerick sat down on moss and pulled out heavy pewter watch and let drove cool off for thirty minutes and kotick could hear fog-dew dripping off brim of his cap then ten or twelve men each with an iron-bound club three or four feet long came up and kerick pointed out one or two of drove that were bitten by their companions or hot and men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made of skin of walrus ’ throat and then kerick said “ let go ” and then men clubbed seals on head as fast as they could ten minutes later little kotick did not recognize his friends any more for their skins were ripped off from nose hind flippers whipped off and thrown down on ground in pile that was enough for kotick he turned and galloped ( seal can gallop very swiftly for short time ) back sea ; his little new mustache bristling with horror at sea lion ’ neck where great sea lions sit on edge of surf he flung himself flipper-overhead into cool water and rocked there gasping miserably “ what ’ here ” said sea lion gruffly for as rule sea lions keep themselves themselves “ scoochnie ochen scoochnie ” ( “ i ’ lonesome very lonesome ” ) said kotick “ they ’ killing all holluschickie on all beaches ” sea lion turned his head inshore “ nonsense ” he said “ your friends are making as much noise as ever you must have seen old kerick polishing off drove he ’ done that for thirty years. ” “ it ’ horrible ” said kotick backing water as wave went over him and steadying himself with screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all standing within three inches of jagged edge of rock “ well done for yearling ” said sea lion who could appreciate good swimming “ i suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it but if you seals will come here year after year of course men get know of it and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will always be driven. ” “ ’ there any such island ” began kotick “ i ’ followed poltoos [ halibut ] for twenty years and i can ’ say i ’ found it yet but look here -- you seem have fondness for talking your betters -- suppose you go walrus islet and talk sea vitch he may know something don ’ flounce off like that it ’ six-mile swim and if i were you i should haul out and take nap first little one. ” kotick thought that that was good advice so he swam round his own beach hauled out and slept for half an hour twitching all over as seals will then he headed straight for walrus islet little low sheet of rocky island almost due northeast from novastoshnah all ledges and rock and gulls ’ nests where walrus herded by themselves he landed close old sea vitch -- big ugly bloated pimpled fat-necked long-tusked walrus of north pacific who has no manners except when he is asleep -- as he was then with his hind flippers half in and half out of surf “ wake up ” barked kotick for gulls were making great noise “ hah ho hmph what ’ that ” said sea vitch and he struck next walrus blow with his tusks and waked him up and next struck next and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction but right one “ hi it ’ ” said kotick bobbing in surf and looking like little white slug “ well may i be -- skinned ” said sea vitch and they all looked at kotick as you can fancy club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at little boy kotick did not care hear any more about skinning just then ; he had seen enough of it so he called out : “ ’ there any place for seals go where men don ’ ever come ” “ go and find out ” said sea vitch shutting his eyes “ run away we ’ busy here. ” kotick made his dolphin-jump in air and shouted as loud as he could : “ clam-eater clam-eater ” he knew that sea vitch never caught fish in his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed ; though he pretended be very terrible person naturally chickies and gooverooskies and epatkas -- burgomaster gulls and kittiwakes and puffins who are always looking for chance be rude took up cry and -- so limmershin told -- for nearly five minutes you could not have heard gun fired on walrus islet all population was yelling and screaming “ clam-eater stareek [ old man ] ” while sea vitch rolled from side side grunting and coughing “ now will you tell ” said kotick all out of breath “ go and ask sea cow ” said sea vitch “ if he is living still he ’ be able tell you. ” “ how shall i know sea cow when i meet him ” said kotick sheering off “ he ’ only thing in sea uglier than sea vitch ” screamed burgomaster gull wheeling under sea vitch ’ nose “ uglier and with worse manners stareek ” kotick swam back novastoshnah leaving gulls scream there he found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt discover quiet place for seals they told him that men had always driven holluschickie -- it was part of day ’ work -- and that if he did not like see ugly things he should not have gone killing grounds but none of other seals had seen killing and that made difference between him and his friends besides kotick was white seal “ what you must do ” said old sea catch after he had heard his son ’ adventures “ is grow up and be big seal like your father and have nursery on beach and then they will leave you alone in another five years you ought be able fight for yourself. ” even gentle matkah his mother said : “ you will never be able stop killing go and play in sea kotick. ” and kotick went off and danced fire-dance with very heavy little heart that autumn he left beach as soon as he could and set off alone because of notion in his bullet-head he was going find sea cow if there was such person in sea and he was going find quiet island with good firm beaches for seals live on where men could not get at them so he explored and explored by himself from north south pacific swimming as much as three hundred miles in day and night he met with more adventures than can be told and narrowly escaped being caught by basking shark and spotted shark and hammerhead and he met all untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down seas and heavy polite fish and scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years and grow very proud of it ; but he never met sea cow and he never found an island that he could fancy if beach was good and hard with slope behind it for seals play on there was always smoke of whaler on horizon boiling down blubber and kotick knew what that meant or else he could see that seals had once visited island and been killed off and kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again he picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross who told him that kerguelen island was very place for peace and quiet and when kotick went down there he was all but smashed pieces against some wicked black cliffs in heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder yet as he pulled out against gale he could see that even there had once been seal nursery and it was so in all other islands that he visited limmershin gave long list of them for he said that kotick spent five seasons exploring with four months ’ rest each year at novastoshnah when holluschickie used make fun of him and his imaginary islands he went gallapagos horrid dry place on equator where he was nearly baked death ; he went georgia islands orkneys emerald island little nightingale island gough ’ island bouvet ’ island crossets and even little speck of an island south of cape of good hope but everywhere people of sea told him same things seals had come those islands once upon time but men had killed them all off even when he swam thousands of miles out of pacific and got place called cape corrientes ( that was when he was coming back from gough ’ island ) he found few hundred mangy seals on rock and they told him that men came there that nearly broke his heart and he headed round horn back his own beaches ; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of green trees where he found an old old seal who was dying and kotick caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows “ now ” said kotick “ i am going back novastoshnah and if i am driven killing-pens with holluschickie i shall not care. ” old seal said “ try once more i am last of lost rookery of masafuera and in days when men killed us by hundred thousand there was story on beaches that some day white seal would come out of north and lead seal people quiet place i am old and i shall never live see that day but others will try once more. ” and kotick curled up his mustache ( it was beauty ) and said “ i am only white seal that has ever been born on beaches and i am only seal black or white who ever thought of looking for new islands. ” this cheered him immensely ; and when he came back novastoshnah that summer matkah his mother begged him marry and settle down for he was no longer holluschick but full-grown sea-catch with curly white mane on his shoulders as heavy as big and as fierce as his father “ give another season ” he said “ remember mother it is always seventh wave that goes farthest up beach. ” curiously enough there was another seal who thought that she would put off marrying till next year and kotick danced fire-dance with her all down lukannon beach night before he set off on his last exploration this time he went westward because he had fallen on trail of great shoal of halibut and he needed at least one hundred pounds of fish day keep him in good condition he chased them till he was tired and then he curled himself up and went sleep on hollows of ground swell that sets in copper island he knew coast perfectly well so about midnight when he felt himself gently bumped on weed-bed he said “ hm tide ’ running strong tonight ” and turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched then he jumped like cat for he saw huge things nosing about in shoal water and browsing on heavy fringes of weeds “ by great combers of magellan ” he said beneath his mustache “ who in deep sea are these people ” they were like no walrus sea lion seal bear whale shark fish squid or scallop that kotick had ever seen before they were between twenty and thirty feet long and they had no hind flippers but shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet leather their heads were most foolish-looking things you ever saw and they balanced on ends of their tails in deep water when they weren ’ grazing bowing solemnly each other and waving their front flippers as fat man waves his arm “ ahem ” said kotick “ good sport gentlemen ” big things answered by bowing and waving their flippers like frog footman when they began feeding again kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces that they could twitch apart about foot and bring together again with whole bushel of seaweed between splits they tucked stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly “ messy style of feeding that ” said kotick they bowed again and kotick began lose his temper “ very good ” he said “ if you do happen have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn ’ show off so i see you bow gracefully but i should like know your names. ” split lips moved and twitched ; and glassy green eyes stared but they did not speak “ well ” said kotick “ you ’ only people i ’ ever met uglier than sea vitch -- and with worse manners. ” then he remembered in flash what burgomaster gull had screamed him when he was little yearling at walrus islet and he tumbled backward in water for he knew that he had found sea cow at last sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in weed and kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked up in his travels ; and sea people talk nearly as many languages as human beings but sea cows did not answer because sea cow can not talk he has only six bones in his neck where he ought have seven and they say under sea that that prevents him from speaking even his companions but as you know he has an extra joint in his foreflipper and by waving it up and down and about he makes what answers sort of clumsy telegraphic code by daylight kotick ’ mane was standing on end and his temper was gone where dead crabs go then sea cow began travel northward very slowly stopping hold absurd bowing councils from time time and kotick followed them saying himself “ people who are such idiots as these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn ’ found out some safe island and what is good enough for sea cow is good enough for sea catch all same i wish they ’ hurry. ” it was weary work for kotick herd never went more than forty or fifty miles day and stopped feed at night and kept close shore all time ; while kotick swam round them and over them and under them but he could not hurry them up one-half mile as they went farther north they held bowing council every few hours and kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were following up warm current of water and then he respected them more one night they sank through shiny water -- sank like stones -- and for first time since he had known them began swim quickly kotick followed and pace astonished him for he never dreamed that sea cow was anything of swimmer they headed for cliff by shore -- cliff that ran down into deep water and plunged into dark hole at foot of it twenty fathoms under sea it was long long swim and kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of dark tunnel they led him through “ my wig ” he said when he rose gasping and puffing into open water at farther end “ it was long dive but it was worth it. ” sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along edges of finest beaches that kotick had ever seen there were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles exactly fitted make seal-nurseries and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them and there were rollers for seals dance in and long grass roll in and sand dunes climb up and down and best of all kotick knew by feel of water which never deceives true sea catch that no men had ever come there first thing he did was assure himself that fishing was good and then he swam along beaches and counted up delightful low sandy islands half hidden in beautiful rolling fog away northward out sea ran line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let ship come within six miles of beach and between islands and mainland was stretch of deep water that ran up perpendicular cliffs and somewhere below cliffs was mouth of tunnel “ it ’ novastoshnah over again but ten times better ” said kotick “ sea cow must be wiser than i thought men can ’ come down cliffs even if there were any men ; and shoals seaward would knock ship splinters if any place in sea is safe this is it. ” he began think of seal he had left behind him but though he was in hurry go back novastoshnah he thoroughly explored new country so that he would be able answer all questions then he dived and made sure of mouth of tunnel and raced through southward no one but sea cow or seal would have dreamed of there being such place and when he looked back at cliffs even kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them he was six days going home though he was not swimming slowly ; and when he hauled out just above sea lion ’ neck first person he met was seal who had been waiting for him and she saw by look in his eyes that he had found his island at last but holluschickie and sea catch his father and all other seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered and young seal about his own age said “ this is all very well kotick but you can ’ come from no one knows where and order us off like this remember we ’ been fighting for our nurseries and that ’ thing you never did you preferred prowling about in sea. ” other seals laughed at this and young seal began twisting his head from side side he had just married that year and was making great fuss about it “ i ’ no nursery fight for ” said kotick “ i only want show you all place where you will be safe what ’ use of fighting ” “ oh if you ’ trying back out of course i ’ no more say ” said young seal with an ugly chuckle “ will you come with if i win ” said kotick and green light came into his eye for he was very angry at having fight at all “ very good ” said young seal carelessly “ if you win i ’ come. ” he had no time change his mind for kotick ’ head was out and his teeth sunk in blubber of young seal ’ neck then he threw himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down beach shook him and knocked him over then kotick roared seals : “ i ’ done my best for you these five seasons past i ’ found you island where you ’ be safe but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks you won ’ believe i ’ going teach you now look out for yourselves ” limmershin told that never in his life -- and limmershin sees ten thousand big seals fighting every year -- never in all his little life did he see anything like kotick ’ charge into nurseries he flung himself at biggest sea catch he could find caught him by throat choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for mercy and then threw him aside and attacked next you see kotick had never fasted for four months as big seals did every year and his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition and best of all he had never fought before his curly white mane stood up with rage and his eyes flamed and his big dog teeth glistened and he was splendid look at old sea catch his father saw him tearing past hauling grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut and upsetting young bachelors in all directions ; and sea catch gave roar and shouted : “ he may be fool but he is best fighter on beaches don ’ tackle your father my son he ’ with you ” kotick roared in answer and old sea catch waddled in with his mustache on end blowing like locomotive while matkah and seal that was going marry kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk it was gorgeous fight for two fought as long as there was seal that dared lift up his head and when there were none they paraded grandly up and down beach side by side bellowing at night just as northern lights were winking and flashing through fog kotick climbed bare rock and looked down on scattered nurseries and torn and bleeding seals “ now ” he said “ i ’ taught you your lesson. ” “ my wig ” said old sea catch boosting himself up stiffly for he was fearfully mauled “ killer whale himself could not have cut them up worse son i ’ proud of you and what ’ more i ’ come with you your island -- if there is such place. ” “ hear you fat pigs of sea who comes with sea cow ’ tunnel answer or i shall teach you again ” roared kotick there was murmur like ripple of tide all up and down beaches “ we will come ” said thousands of tired voices “ we will follow kotick white seal. ” then kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly he was not white seal any more but red from head tail all same he would have scorned look at or touch one of his wounds week later he and his army ( nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old seals ) went away north sea cow ’ tunnel kotick leading them and seals that stayed at novastoshnah called them idiots but next spring when they all met off fishing banks of pacific kotick ’ seals told such tales of new beaches beyond sea cow ’ tunnel that more and more seals left novastoshnah of course it was not all done at once for seals are not very clever and they need long time turn things over in their minds but year after year more seals went away from novastoshnah and lukannon and other nurseries quiet sheltered beaches where kotick sits all summer through getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year while holluschickie play around him in that sea where no man comes lukannon this is great deep-sea song that all st. paul seals sing when they are heading back their beaches in summer it is sort of very sad seal national anthem i met my mates in morning ( and oh but i am old ) where roaring on ledges summer ground-swell rolled ; i heard them lift chorus that drowned breakers ’ song -- beaches of lukannon -- two million voices strong song of pleasant stations beside salt lagoons song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down dunes song of midnight dances that churned sea flame -- beaches of lukannon -- before sealers came i met my mates in morning ( i ’ never meet them more ) ; they came and went in legions that darkened all shore and ’ er foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach we hailed landing-parties and we sang them up beach beaches of lukannon -- winter wheat so tall -- dripping crinkled lichens and sea-fog drenching all platforms of our playground all shining smooth and worn beaches of lukannon -- home where we were born i met my mates in morning broken scattered band men shoot us in water and club us on land ; men drive us salt house like silly sheep and tame and still we sing lukannon -- before sealers came wheel down wheel down southward ; oh gooverooska go and tell deep-sea viceroys story of our woe ; ere empty as shark ’ egg tempest flings ashore beaches of lukannon shall know their sons no more “ rikki-tikki-tavi ” at hole where he went in red-eye called wrinkle-skin hear what little red-eye saith : “ nag come up and dance with death ” eye eye and head head ( keep measure nag ) this shall end when one is dead ; ( at thy pleasure nag ) turn for turn and twist for twist -- ( run and hide thee nag ) hah hooded death has missed ( woe betide thee nag ) this is story of great war that rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed through bath-rooms of big bungalow in segowlee cantonment darzee tailorbird helped him and chuchundra musk-rat who never comes out into middle of floor but always creeps round by wall gave him advice but rikki-tikki did real fighting he was mongoose rather like little cat in his fur and his tail but quite like weasel in his head and his habits his eyes and end of his restless nose were pink he could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg front or back that he chose use he could fluff up his tail till it looked like bottle brush and his war cry as he scuttled through long grass was : “ rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk ” one day high summer flood washed him out of burrow where he lived with his father and mother and carried him kicking and clucking down roadside ditch he found little wisp of grass floating there and clung it till he lost his senses when he revived he was lying in hot sun on middle of garden path very draggled indeed and small boy was saying “ here ’ dead mongoose let ’ have funeral. ” “ no ” said his mother “ let ’ take him in and dry him perhaps he ’ really dead. ” they took him into house and big man picked him up between his finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked so they wrapped him in cotton wool and warmed him over little fire and he opened his eyes and sneezed “ now ” said big man ( he was an englishman who had just moved into bungalow ) “ don ’ frighten him and we ’ see what he ’ do. ” it is hardest thing in world frighten mongoose because he is eaten up from nose tail with curiosity motto of all mongoose family is “ run and find out ” and rikki-tikki was true mongoose he looked at cotton wool decided that it was not good eat ran all round table sat up and put his fur in order scratched himself and jumped on small boy ’ shoulder “ don ’ be frightened teddy ” said his father “ that ’ his way of making friends. ” “ ouch he ’ tickling under my chin ” said teddy rikki-tikki looked down between boy ’ collar and neck snuffed at his ear and climbed down floor where he sat rubbing his nose “ good gracious ” said teddy ’ mother “ and that ’ wild creature i suppose he ’ so tame because we ’ been kind him. ” “ all mongooses are like that ” said her husband “ if teddy ’ pick him up by tail or try put him in cage he ’ run in and out of house all day long let ’ give him something eat. ” they gave him little piece of raw meat rikki-tikki liked it immensely and when it was finished he went out into veranda and sat in sunshine and fluffed up his fur make it dry roots then he felt better “ there are more things find out about in this house ” he said himself “ than all my family could find out in all their lives i shall certainly stay and find out. ” he spent all that day roaming over house he nearly drowned himself in bath-tubs put his nose into ink on writing table and burned it on end of big man ’ cigar for he climbed up in big man ’ lap see how writing was done at nightfall he ran into teddy ’ nursery watch how kerosene lamps were lighted and when teddy went bed rikki-tikki climbed up but he was restless companion because he had get up and attend every noise all through night and find out what made it teddy ’ mother and father came in last thing look at their boy and rikki-tikki was awake on pillow “ i don ’ like that ” said teddy ’ mother “ he may bite child. ” “ he ’ do no such thing ” said father “ teddy ’ safer with that little beast than if he had bloodhound watch him if snake came into nursery now -- ” but teddy ’ mother wouldn ’ think of anything so awful early in morning rikki-tikki came early breakfast in veranda riding on teddy ’ shoulder and they gave him banana and some boiled egg he sat on all their laps one after other because every well-brought-up mongoose always hopes be house mongoose some day and have rooms run about in ; and rikki-tikki ’ mother ( she used live in general ’ house at segowlee ) had carefully told rikki what do if ever he came across white men then rikki-tikki went out into garden see what was be seen it was large garden only half cultivated with bushes as big as summer-houses of marshal niel roses lime and orange trees clumps of bamboos and thickets of high grass rikki-tikki licked his lips “ this is splendid hunting-ground ” he said and his tail grew bottle-brushy at thought of it and he scuttled up and down garden snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in thorn-bush it was darzee tailorbird and his wife they had made beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up edges with fibers and had filled hollow with cotton and downy fluff nest swayed and fro as they sat on rim and cried “ what is matter ” asked rikki-tikki “ we are very miserable ” said darzee “ one of our babies fell out of nest yesterday and nag ate him. ” “ h ’ ” said rikki-tikki “ that is very sad -- but i am stranger here who is nag ” darzee and his wife only cowered down in nest without answering for from thick grass at foot of bush there came low hiss -- horrid cold sound that made rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet then inch by inch out of grass rose up head and spread hood of nag big black cobra and he was five feet long from tongue tail when he had lifted one-third of himself clear of ground he stayed balancing and fro exactly as dandelion tuft balances in wind and he looked at rikki-tikki with wicked snake ’ eyes that never change their expression whatever snake may be thinking of “ who is nag ” said he “ i am nag great god brahm put his mark upon all our people when first cobra spread his hood keep sun off brahm as he slept look and be afraid ” he spread out his hood more than ever and rikki-tikki saw spectacle-mark on back of it that looks exactly like eye part of hook-and-eye fastening he was afraid for minute but it is impossible for mongoose stay frightened for any length of time and though rikki-tikki had never met live cobra before his mother had fed him on dead ones and he knew that all grown mongoose ’ business in life was fight and eat snakes nag knew that and at bottom of his cold heart he was afraid “ well ” said rikki-tikki and his tail began fluff up again “ marks or no marks do you think it is right for you eat fledglings out of nest ” nag was thinking himself and watching least little movement in grass behind rikki-tikki he knew that mongooses in garden meant death sooner or later for him and his family but he wanted get rikki-tikki off his guard so he dropped his head little and put it on one side “ let us talk ” he said “ you eat eggs why should not i eat birds ” “ behind you look behind you ” sang darzee rikki-tikki knew better than waste time in staring he jumped up in air as high as he could go and just under him whizzed by head of nagaina nag ’ wicked wife she had crept up behind him as he was talking make an end of him he heard her savage hiss as stroke missed he came down almost across her back and if he had been an old mongoose he would have known that then was time break her back with one bite ; but he was afraid of terrible lashing return stroke of cobra he bit indeed but did not bite long enough and he jumped clear of whisking tail leaving nagaina torn and angry “ wicked wicked darzee ” said nag lashing up as high as he could reach toward nest in thorn-bush but darzee had built it out of reach of snakes and it only swayed and fro rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot ( when mongoose ’ eyes grow red he is angry ) and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like little kangaroo and looked all round him and chattered with rage but nag and nagaina had disappeared into grass when snake misses its stroke it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means do next rikki-tikki did not care follow them for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once so he trotted off gravel path near house and sat down think it was serious matter for him if you read old books of natural history you will find they say that when mongoose fights snake and happens get bitten he runs off and eats some herb that cures him that is not true victory is only matter of quickness of eye and quickness of foot -- snake ’ blow against mongoose ’ jump -- and as no eye can follow motion of snake ’ head when it strikes this makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb rikki-tikki knew he was young mongoose and it made him all more pleased think that he had managed escape blow from behind it gave him confidence in himself and when teddy came running down path rikki-tikki was ready be petted but just as teddy was stooping something wriggled little in dust and tiny voice said : “ be careful i am death ” it was karait dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on dusty earth ; and his bite is as dangerous as cobra ’ but he is so small that nobody thinks of him and so he does more harm people rikki-tikki ’ eyes grew red again and he danced up karait with peculiar rocking swaying motion that he had inherited from his family it looks very funny but it is so perfectly balanced gait that you can fly off from it at any angle you please and in dealing with snakes this is an advantage if rikki-tikki had only known he was doing much more dangerous thing than fighting nag for karait is so small and can turn so quickly that unless rikki bit him close back of head he would get return stroke in his eye or his lip but rikki did not know his eyes were all red and he rocked back and forth looking for good place hold karait struck out rikki jumped sideways and tried run in but wicked little dusty gray head lashed within fraction of his shoulder and he had jump over body and head followed his heels close teddy shouted house : “ oh look here our mongoose is killing snake. ” and rikki-tikki heard scream from teddy ’ mother his father ran out with stick but by time he came up karait had lunged out once far and rikki-tikki had sprung jumped on snake ’ back dropped his head far between his forelegs bitten as high up back as he could get hold and rolled away that bite paralyzed karait and rikki-tikki was just going eat him up from tail after custom of his family at dinner when he remembered that full meal makes slow mongoose and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready he must keep himself thin he went away for dust bath under castor-oil bushes while teddy ’ father beat dead karait “ what is use of that ” thought rikki-tikki “ i have settled it all ; ” and then teddy ’ mother picked him up from dust and hugged him crying that he had saved teddy from death and teddy ’ father said that he was providence and teddy looked on with big scared eyes rikki-tikki was rather amused at all fuss which of course he did not understand teddy ’ mother might just as well have petted teddy for playing in dust rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself that night at dinner walking and fro among wine-glasses on table he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things but he remembered nag and nagaina and though it was very pleasant be patted and petted by teddy ’ mother and sit on teddy ’ shoulder his eyes would get red from time time and he would go off into his long war cry of “ rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk ” teddy carried him off bed and insisted on rikki-tikki sleeping under his chin rikki-tikki was well bred bite or scratch but as soon as teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round house and in dark he ran up against chuchundra musk-rat creeping around by wall chuchundra is broken-hearted little beast he whimpers and cheeps all night trying make up his mind run into middle of room but he never gets there “ don ’ kill ” said chuchundra almost weeping “ rikki-tikki don ’ kill ” “ do you think snake-killer kills muskrats ” said rikki-tikki scornfully “ those who kill snakes get killed by snakes ” said chuchundra more sorrowfully than ever “ and how am i be sure that nag won ’ mistake for you some dark night ” “ there ’ not least danger ” said rikki-tikki “ but nag is in garden and i know you don ’ go there. ” “ my cousin chua rat told -- ” said chuchundra and then he stopped “ told you what ” “ h ’ sh nag is everywhere rikki-tikki you should have talked chua in garden. ” “ i ’ -- so you must tell quick chuchundra or i ’ bite you ” chuchundra sat down and cried till tears rolled off his whiskers “ i am very poor man ” he sobbed “ i never had spirit enough run out into middle of room h ’ sh i ’ tell you anything can ’ you hear rikki-tikki ” rikki-tikki listened house was as still as still but he thought he could just catch faintest scratch-scratch in world -- noise as faint as that of wasp walking on window-pane -- dry scratch of snake ’ scales on brick-work “ that ’ nag or nagaina ” he said himself “ and he is crawling into bath-room sluice you ’ right chuchundra ; i should have talked chua. ” he stole off teddy ’ bath-room but there was nothing there and then teddy ’ mother ’ bathroom at bottom of smooth plaster wall there was brick pulled out make sluice for bath water and as rikki-tikki stole in by masonry curb where bath is put he heard nag and nagaina whispering together outside in moonlight “ when house is emptied of people ” said nagaina her husband “ he will have go away and then garden will be our own again go in quietly and remember that big man who killed karait is first one bite then come out and tell and we will hunt for rikki-tikki together. ” “ but are you sure that there is anything be gained by killing people ” said nag “ everything when there were no people in bungalow did we have any mongoose in garden so long as bungalow is empty we are king and queen of garden ; and remember that as soon as our eggs in melon bed hatch ( as they may tomorrow ) our children will need room and quiet. ” “ i had not thought of that ” said nag “ i will go but there is no need that we should hunt for rikki-tikki afterward i will kill big man and his wife and child if i can and come away quietly then bungalow will be empty and rikki-tikki will go. ” rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this and then nag ’ head came through sluice and his five feet of cold body followed it angry as he was rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw size of big cobra nag coiled himself up raised his head and looked into bathroom in dark and rikki could see his eyes glitter “ now if i kill him here nagaina will know ; and if i fight him on open floor odds are in his favor what am i do ” said rikki-tikki-tavi nag waved and fro and then rikki-tikki heard him drinking from biggest water-jar that was used fill bath “ that is good ” said snake “ now when karait was killed big man had stick he may have that stick still but when he comes in bathe in morning he will not have stick i shall wait here till he comes nagaina -- do you hear -- i shall wait here in cool till daytime. ” there was no answer from outside so rikki-tikki knew nagaina had gone away nag coiled himself down coil by coil round bulge at bottom of water jar and rikki-tikki stayed still as death after an hour he began move muscle by muscle toward jar nag was asleep and rikki-tikki looked at his big back wondering which would be best place for good hold “ if i don ’ break his back at first jump ” said rikki “ he can still fight and if he fights -- rikki ” he looked at thickness of neck below hood but that was much for him ; and bite near tail would only make nag savage “ it must be head ” ’ he said at last ; “ head above hood and when i am once there i must not let go. ” then he jumped head was lying little clear of water jar under curve of it ; and as his teeth met rikki braced his back against bulge of red earthenware hold down head this gave him just one second ’ purchase and he made most of it then he was battered and fro as rat is shaken by dog -- and fro on floor up and down and around in great circles but his eyes were red and he held on as body cart-whipped over floor upsetting tin dipper and soap dish and flesh brush and banged against tin side of bath as he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter for he made sure he would be banged death and for honor of his family he preferred be found with his teeth locked he was dizzy aching and felt shaken pieces when something went off like thunderclap just behind him hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur big man had been wakened by noise and had fired both barrels of shotgun into nag just behind hood rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut for now he was quite sure he was dead but head did not move and big man picked him up and said “ it ’ mongoose again alice little chap has saved our lives now. ” then teddy ’ mother came in with very white face and saw what was left of nag and rikki-tikki dragged himself teddy ’ bedroom and spent half rest of night shaking himself tenderly find out whether he really was broken into forty pieces as he fancied when morning came he was very stiff but well pleased with his doings “ now i have nagaina settle with and she will be worse than five nags and there ’ no knowing when eggs she spoke of will hatch goodness i must go and see darzee ” he said without waiting for breakfast rikki-tikki ran thornbush where darzee was singing song of triumph at top of his voice news of nag ’ death was all over garden for sweeper had thrown body on rubbish-heap “ oh you stupid tuft of feathers ” said rikki-tikki angrily “ is this time sing ” “ nag is dead -- is dead -- is dead ” sang darzee “ valiant rikki-tikki caught him by head and held fast big man brought bang-stick and nag fell in two pieces he will never eat my babies again. ” “ all that ’ true enough but where ’ nagaina ” said rikki-tikki looking carefully round him “ nagaina came bathroom sluice and called for nag ” darzee went on “ and nag came out on end of stick -- sweeper picked him up on end of stick and threw him upon rubbish heap let us sing about great red-eyed rikki-tikki ” and darzee filled his throat and sang “ if i could get up your nest i ’ roll your babies out ” said rikki-tikki “ you don ’ know when do right thing at right time you ’ safe enough in your nest there but it ’ war for down here stop singing minute darzee. ” “ for great beautiful rikki-tikki ’ sake i will stop ” said darzee “ what is it killer of terrible nag ” “ where is nagaina for third time ” “ on rubbish heap by stables mourning for nag great is rikki-tikki with white teeth. ” “ bother my white teeth have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs ” “ in melon bed on end nearest wall where sun strikes nearly all day she hid them there weeks ago. ” “ and you never thought it worth while tell end nearest wall you said ” “ rikki-tikki you are not going eat her eggs ” “ not eat exactly ; no darzee if you have grain of sense you will fly off stables and pretend that your wing is broken and let nagaina chase you away this bush i must get melon-bed and if i went there now she ’ see me. ” darzee was feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more than one idea at time in his head and just because he knew that nagaina ’ children were born in eggs like his own he ’ think at first that it was fair kill them but his wife was sensible bird and she knew that cobra ’ eggs meant young cobras later on so she flew off from nest and left darzee keep babies warm and continue his song about death of nag darzee was very like man in some ways she fluttered in front of nagaina by rubbish heap and cried out “ oh my wing is broken boy in house threw stone at and broke it. ” then she fluttered more desperately than ever nagaina lifted up her head and hissed “ you warned rikki-tikki when i would have killed him indeed and truly you ’ chosen bad place be lame in. ” and she moved toward darzee ’ wife slipping along over dust “ boy broke it with stone ” shrieked darzee ’ wife “ well it may be some consolation you when you ’ dead know that i shall settle accounts with boy my husband lies on rubbish heap this morning but before night boy in house will lie very still what is use of running away i am sure catch you little fool look at ” darzee ’ wife knew better than do that for bird who looks at snake ’ eyes gets so frightened that she can not move darzee ’ wife fluttered on piping sorrowfully and never leaving ground and nagaina quickened her pace rikki-tikki heard them going up path from stables and he raced for end of melon patch near wall there in warm litter above melons very cunningly hidden he found twenty-five eggs about size of bantam ’ eggs but with whitish skin instead of shell “ i was not day soon ” he said for he could see baby cobras curled up inside skin and he knew that minute they were hatched they could each kill man or mongoose he bit off tops of eggs as fast as he could taking care crush young cobras and turned over litter from time time see whether he had missed any at last there were only three eggs left and rikki-tikki began chuckle himself when he heard darzee ’ wife screaming : “ rikki-tikki i led nagaina toward house and she has gone into veranda and -- oh come quickly -- she means killing ” rikki-tikki smashed two eggs and tumbled backward down melon-bed with third egg in his mouth and scuttled veranda as hard as he could put foot ground teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast but rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating anything they sat stone-still and their faces were white nagaina was coiled up on matting by teddy ’ chair within easy striking distance of teddy ’ bare leg and she was swaying and fro singing song of triumph “ son of big man that killed nag ” she hissed “ stay still i am not ready yet wait little keep very still all you three if you move i strike and if you do not move i strike oh foolish people who killed my nag ” teddy ’ eyes were fixed on his father and all his father could do was whisper “ sit still teddy you ’ move teddy keep still. ” then rikki-tikki came up and cried “ turn round nagaina turn and fight ” “ all in good time ” said she without moving her eyes “ i will settle my account with you presently look at your friends rikki-tikki they are still and white they are afraid they dare not move and if you come step nearer i strike. ” “ look at your eggs ” said rikki-tikki “ in melon bed near wall go and look nagaina ” big snake turned half around and saw egg on veranda “ ah-h give it ” she said rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of egg and his eyes were blood-red “ what price for snake ’ egg for young cobra for young king cobra for last -- very last of brood ants are eating all others down by melon bed. ” nagaina spun clear round forgetting everything for sake of one egg rikki-tikki saw teddy ’ father shoot out big hand catch teddy by shoulder and drag him across little table with tea-cups safe and out of reach of nagaina “ tricked tricked tricked rikk-tck-tck ” chuckled rikki-tikki “ boy is safe and it was i -- i -- i that caught nag by hood last night in bathroom. ” then he began jump up and down all four feet together his head close floor “ he threw and fro but he could not shake off he was dead before big man blew him in two i did it rikki-tikki-tck-tck come then nagaina come and fight with you shall not be widow long. ” nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing teddy and egg lay between rikki-tikki ’ paws “ give egg rikki-tikki give last of my eggs and i will go away and never come back ” she said lowering her hood “ yes you will go away and you will never come back for you will go rubbish heap with nag fight widow big man has gone for his gun fight ” rikki-tikki was bounding all round nagaina keeping just out of reach of her stroke his little eyes like hot coals nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at him rikki-tikki jumped up and backward again and again and again she struck and each time her head came with whack on matting of veranda and she gathered herself together like watch spring then rikki-tikki danced in circle get behind her and nagaina spun round keep her head his head so that rustle of her tail on matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by wind he had forgotten egg it still lay on veranda and nagaina came nearer and nearer it till at last while rikki-tikki was drawing breath she caught it in her mouth turned veranda steps and flew like an arrow down path with rikki-tikki behind her when cobra runs for her life she goes like whip-lash flicked across horse ’ neck rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her or all trouble would begin again she headed straight for long grass by thorn-bush and as he was running rikki-tikki heard darzee still singing his foolish little song of triumph but darzee ’ wife was wiser she flew off her nest as nagaina came along and flapped her wings about nagaina ’ head if darzee had helped they might have turned her but nagaina only lowered her hood and went on still instant ’ delay brought rikki-tikki up her and as she plunged into rat-hole where she and nag used live his little white teeth were clenched on her tail and he went down with her -- and very few mongooses however wise and old they may be care follow cobra into its hole it was dark in hole ; and rikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give nagaina room turn and strike at him he held on savagely and stuck out his feet act as brakes on dark slope of hot moist earth then grass by mouth of hole stopped waving and darzee said “ it is all over with rikki-tikki we must sing his death song valiant rikki-tikki is dead for nagaina will surely kill him underground. ” so he sang very mournful song that he made up on spur of minute and just as he got most touching part grass quivered again and rikki-tikki covered with dirt dragged himself out of hole leg by leg licking his whiskers darzee stopped with little shout rikki-tikki shook some of dust out of his fur and sneezed “ it is all over ” he said “ widow will never come out again. ” and red ants that live between grass stems heard him and began troop down one after another see if he had spoken truth rikki-tikki curled himself up in grass and slept where he was -- slept and slept till it was late in afternoon for he had done hard day ’ work “ now ” he said when he awoke “ i will go back house tell coppersmith darzee and he will tell garden that nagaina is dead. ” coppersmith is bird who makes noise exactly like beating of little hammer on copper pot ; and reason he is always making it is because he is town crier every indian garden and tells all news everybody who cares listen as rikki-tikki went up path he heard his “ attention ” notes like tiny dinner gong and then steady “ ding-dong-tock nag is dead -- dong nagaina is dead ding-dong-tock ” that set all birds in garden singing and frogs croaking for nag and nagaina used eat frogs as well as little birds when rikki got house teddy and teddy ’ mother ( she looked very white still for she had been fainting ) and teddy ’ father came out and almost cried over him ; and that night he ate all that was given him till he could eat no more and went bed on teddy ’ shoulder where teddy ’ mother saw him when she came look late at night “ he saved our lives and teddy ’ life ” she said her husband “ just think he saved all our lives. ” rikki-tikki woke up with jump for mongooses are light sleepers “ oh it ’ you ” said he “ what are you bothering for all cobras are dead and if they weren ’ i ’ here. ” rikki-tikki had right be proud of himself but he did not grow proud and he kept that garden as mongoose should keep it with tooth and jump and spring and bite till never cobra dared show its head inside walls darzee ’ chant ( sung in honor of rikki-tikki-tavi ) singer and tailor am i -- doubled joys that i know -- proud of my lilt sky proud of house that i sew -- over and under so weave i my music -- so weave i house that i sew sing your

with nightingale words -- nay i will praise him instead hear i will sing you praise of bottle-tailed rikki with eyeballs of red ( here rikki-tikki interrupted and rest of song is lost ) toomai of

revisit my lost loves and playmates masterless kala nag which means black snake had served indian government in every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years and as he was fully twenty years old when he was caught that makes him nearly seventy -- ripe age for an elephant he remembered pushing with big leather pad on his forehead at gun stuck in deep mud and that was before afghan war of 1842 and he had not then come his full strength his mother radha pyari -- radha darling -- who had been caught in same drive with kala nag told him before his little milk tusks had dropped out that elephants who were afraid always got hurt kala nag knew that that advice was good for first time that he saw shell burst he backed screaming into stand of piled rifles and bayonets pricked him in all his softest places so before he was twenty-five he gave up being afraid and so he was best-loved and best-looked-after elephant in service of government of india he had carried tents twelve hundred pounds ’ weight of tents on march in upper india he had been hoisted into ship at end of steam crane and taken for days across water and made carry mortar on his back in strange and rocky country very far from india and had seen emperor theodore lying dead in magdala and had come back again in steamer entitled so soldiers said abyssinian war medal he had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at place called ali musjid ten years later ; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles south haul and pile big balks of teak in timberyards at moulmein there he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work after that he was taken off timber-hauling and employed with few score other elephants who were trained business in helping catch wild elephants among garo hills elephants are very strictly preserved by indian government there is one whole department which does nothing else but hunt them and catch them and break them in and send them up and down country as they are needed for work kala nag stood ten fair feet at shoulders and his tusks had been cut off short at five feet and bound round ends prevent them splitting with bands of copper ; but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained elephant could do with real sharpened ones when after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across hills forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into last stockade and big drop gate made of tree trunks lashed together jarred down behind them kala nag at word of command would go into that flaring trumpeting pandemonium ( generally at night when flicker of torches made it difficult judge distances ) and picking out biggest and wildest tusker of mob would hammer him and hustle him into quiet while men on backs of other elephants roped and tied smaller ones there was nothing in way of fighting that kala nag old wise black snake did not know for he had stood up more than once in his time charge of wounded tiger and curling up his soft trunk be out of harm ’ way had knocked springing brute sideways in mid-air with quick sickle cut of his head that he had invented all by himself ; had knocked him over and kneeled upon him with his huge knees till life went out with gasp and howl and there was only fluffy striped thing on ground for kala nag pull by tail “ yes ” said big toomai his driver son of black toomai who had taken him abyssinia and grandson of toomai of elephants who had seen him caught “ there is nothing that black snake fears except he has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him and he will live see four. ” “ he is afraid of also ” said little toomai standing up his full height of four feet with only one rag upon him he was ten years old eldest son of big toomai and according custom he would take his father ’ place on kala nag ’ neck when he grew up and would handle heavy iron ankus elephant goad that had been worn smooth by his father and his grandfather and his great-grandfather he knew what he was talking of ; for he had been born under kala nag ’ shadow had played with end of his trunk before he could walk had taken him down water as soon as he could walk and kala nag would no more have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would have dreamed of killing him on that day when big toomai carried little brown baby under kala nag ’ tusks and told him salute his master that was be “ yes ” said little toomai “ he is afraid of ” and he took long strides up kala nag called him fat old pig and made him lift up his feet one after other “ wah ” said little toomai “ thou art big elephant ” and he wagged his fluffy head quoting his father “ government may pay for elephants but they belong us mahouts when thou art old kala nag there will come some rich rajah and he will buy thee from government on account of thy size and thy manners and then thou wilt have nothing do but carry gold earrings in thy ears and gold howdah on thy back and red cloth covered with gold on thy sides and walk at head of processions of king then i shall sit on thy neck kala nag with silver ankus and men will run before us with golden sticks crying `room for king ’ elephant ’ that will be good kala nag but not so good as this hunting in jungles. ” “ umph ” said big toomai “ thou art boy and as wild as buffalo-calf this running up and down among hills is not best government service i am getting old and i do not love wild elephants give brick elephant lines one stall each elephant and big stumps tie them safely and flat broad roads exercise upon instead of this come-and-go camping aha cawnpore barracks were good there was bazaar close by and only three hours ’ work day. ” little toomai remembered cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing he very much preferred camp life and hated those broad flat roads with daily grubbing for grass in forage reserve and long hours when there was nothing do except watch kala nag fidgeting in his pickets what little toomai liked was scramble up bridle paths that only an elephant could take ; dip into valley below ; glimpses of wild elephants browsing miles away ; rush of frightened pig and peacock under kala nag ’ feet ; blinding warm rains when all hills and valleys smoked ; beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night ; steady cautious drive of wild elephants and mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of last night ’ drive when elephants poured into stockade like boulders in landslide found that they could not get out and flung themselves at heavy posts only be driven back by yells and flaring torches and volleys of blank cartridge even little boy could be of use there and toomai was as useful as three boys he would get his torch and wave it and yell with best but really good time came when driving out began and keddah -- that is stockade -- looked like picture of end of world and men had make signs one another because they could not hear themselves speak then little toomai would climb up top of one of quivering stockade posts his sun-bleached brown hair flying loose all over his shoulders and he looking like goblin in torch-light and as soon as there was lull you could hear his high-pitched yells of encouragement kala nag above trumpeting and crashing and snapping of ropes and groans of tethered elephants “ mael mael kala nag ( go on go on black snake ) dant do ( give him tusk ) somalo somalo ( careful careful ) maro mar ( hit him hit him ) mind post arre arre hai yai kya-a-ah ” he would shout and big fight between kala nag and wild elephant would sway and fro across keddah and old elephant catchers would wipe sweat out of their eyes and find time nod little toomai wriggling with joy on top of posts he did more than wriggle one night he slid down from post and slipped in between elephants and threw up loose end of rope which had dropped driver who was trying get purchase on leg of kicking young calf ( calves always give more trouble than full-grown animals ) kala nag saw him caught him in his trunk and handed him up big toomai who slapped him then and there and put him back on post next morning he gave him scolding and said “ are not good brick elephant lines and little tent carrying enough that thou must needs go elephant catching on thy own account little worthless now those foolish hunters whose pay is less than my pay have spoken petersen sahib of matter. ” little toomai was frightened he did not know much of white men but petersen sahib was greatest white man in world him he was head of all keddah operations -- man who caught all elephants for government of india and who knew more about ways of elephants than any living man “ what -- what will happen ” said little toomai “ happen worst that can happen petersen sahib is madman else why should he go hunting these wild devils he may even require thee be an elephant catcher sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles and at last be trampled death in keddah it is well that this nonsense ends safely next week catching is over and we of plains are sent back our stations then we will march on smooth roads and forget all this hunting but son i am angry that thou shouldst meddle in business that belongs these dirty assamese jungle folk kala nag will obey none but so i must go with him into keddah but he is only fighting elephant and he does not help rope them so i sit at my ease as befits mahout -- not mere hunter -- mahout i say and man who gets pension at end of his service is family of toomai of elephants be trodden underfoot in dirt of keddah bad one wicked one worthless son go and wash kala nag and attend his ears and see that there are no thorns in his feet or else petersen sahib will surely catch thee and make thee wild hunter -- follower of elephant ’ foot tracks jungle bear bah shame go ” little toomai went off without saying word but he told kala nag all his grievances while he was examining his feet “ no matter ” said little toomai turning up fringe of kala nag ’ huge right ear “ they have said my name petersen sahib and perhaps -- and perhaps -- and perhaps -- who knows hai that is big thorn that i have pulled out ” next few days were spent in getting elephants together in walking newly caught wild elephants up and down between couple of tame ones prevent them giving much trouble on downward march plains and in taking stock of blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or lost in forest petersen sahib came in on his clever she-elephant pudmini ; he had been paying off other camps among hills for season was coming an end and there was native clerk sitting at table under tree pay drivers their wages as each man was paid he went back his elephant and joined line that stood ready start catchers and hunters and beaters men of regular keddah who stayed in jungle year in and year out sat on backs of elephants that belonged petersen sahib ’ permanent force or leaned against trees with their guns across their arms and made fun of drivers who were going away and laughed when newly caught elephants broke line and ran about big toomai went up clerk with little toomai behind him and machua appa head tracker said in an undertone friend of his “ there goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least ‘ tis pity send that young jungle-cock molt in plains. ” now petersen sahib had ears all over him as man must have who listens most silent of all living things -- wild elephant he turned where he was lying all along on pudmini ’ back and said “ what is that i did not know of man among plains-drivers who had wit enough rope even dead elephant. ” “ this is not man but boy he went into keddah at last drive and threw barmao there rope when we were trying get that young calf with blotch on his shoulder away from his mother. ” machua appa pointed at little toomai and petersen sahib looked and little toomai bowed earth “ he throw rope he is smaller than picket-pin little one what is thy name ” said petersen sahib little toomai was frightened speak but kala nag was behind him and toomai made sign with his hand and elephant caught him up in his trunk and held him level with pudmini ’ forehead in front of great petersen sahib then little toomai covered his face with his hands for he was only child and except where elephants were concerned he was just as bashful as child could be “ oho ” said petersen sahib smiling underneath his mustache “ and why didst thou teach thy elephant that trick was it help thee steal green corn from roofs of houses when ears are put out dry ” “ not green corn protector of poor -- melons ” said little toomai and all men sitting about broke into roar of laughter most of them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys little toomai was hanging eight feet up in air and he wished very much that he were eight feet underground “ he is toomai my son sahib ” said big toomai scowling “ he is very bad boy and he will end in jail sahib. ” “ of that i have my doubts ” said petersen sahib “ boy who can face full keddah at his age does not end in jails see little one here are four annas spend in sweetmeats because thou hast little head under that great thatch of hair in time thou mayest become hunter too. ” big toomai scowled more than ever “ remember though that keddahs are not good for children play in ” petersen sahib went on “ must i never go there sahib ” asked little toomai with big gasp “ yes. ” petersen sahib smiled again “ when thou hast seen elephants dance that is proper time come when thou hast seen elephants dance and then i will let thee go into all keddahs. ” there was another roar of laughter for that is an old joke among elephant-catchers and it means just never there are great cleared flat places hidden away in forests that are called elephants ’ ball-rooms but even these are only found by accident and no man has ever seen elephants dance when driver boasts of his skill and bravery other drivers say “ and when didst thou see elephants dance ” kala nag put little toomai down and he bowed earth again and went away with his father and gave silver four-anna piece his mother who was nursing his baby brother and they all were put up on kala nag ’ back and line of grunting squealing elephants rolled down hill path plains it was very lively march on account of new elephants who gave trouble at every ford and needed coaxing or beating every other minute big toomai prodded kala nag spitefully for he was very angry but little toomai was happy speak petersen sahib had noticed him and given him money so he felt as private soldier would feel if he had been called out of ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief “ what did petersen sahib mean by elephant dance ” he said at last softly his mother big toomai heard him and grunted “ that thou shouldst never be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers that was what he meant oh you in front what is blocking way ” an assamese driver two or three elephants ahead turned round angrily crying : “ bring up kala nag and knock this youngster of mine into good behavior why should petersen sahib have chosen go down with you donkeys of rice fields lay your beast alongside toomai and let him prod with his tusks by all gods of hills these new elephants are possessed or else they can smell their companions in jungle. ” kala nag hit new elephant in ribs and knocked wind out of him as big toomai said “ we have swept hills of wild elephants at last catch it is only your carelessness in driving must i keep order along whole line ” “ hear him ” said other driver “ we have swept hills ho ho you are very wise you plains people anyone but mud-head who never saw jungle would know that they know that drives are ended for season therefore all wild elephants to-night will -- but why should i waste wisdom on river-turtle ” “ what will they do ” little toomai called out “ ohe little one art thou there well i will tell thee for thou hast cool head they will dance and it behooves thy father who has swept all hills of all elephants double-chain his pickets to-night. ” “ what talk is this ” said big toomai “ for forty years father and son we have tended elephants and we have never heard such moonshine about dances. ” “ yes ; but plainsman who lives in hut knows only four walls of his hut well leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what comes as for their dancing i have seen place where -- bapree-bap how many windings has dihang river here is another ford and we must swim calves stop still you behind there. ” and in this way talking and wrangling and splashing through rivers they made their first march sort of receiving camp for new elephants but they lost their tempers long before they got there then elephants were chained by their hind legs their big stumps of pickets and extra ropes were fitted new elephants and fodder was piled before them and hill drivers went back petersen sahib through afternoon light telling plains drivers be extra careful that night and laughing when plains drivers asked reason little toomai attended kala nag ’ supper and as evening fell wandered through camp unspeakably happy in search of tom-tom when an indian child ’ heart is full he does not run about and make noise in an irregular fashion he sits down sort of revel all by himself and little toomai had been spoken by petersen sahib if he had not found what he wanted i believe he would have been ill. but sweetmeat seller in camp lent him little tom-tom -- drum beaten with flat of hand -- and he sat down cross-legged before kala nag as stars began come out tom-tom in his lap and he thumped and he thumped and he thumped and more he thought of great honor that had been done him more he thumped all alone among elephant fodder there was no tune and no words but thumping made him happy new elephants strained at their ropes and squealed and trumpeted from time time and he could hear his mother in camp hut putting his small brother sleep with an old old song about great god shiv who once told all animals what they should eat it is very soothing lullaby and first verse says : shiv who poured harvest and made winds blow sitting at doorways of day of long ago gave each his portion food and toil and fate from king upon guddee beggar at gate all things made he -- shiva preserver mahadeo mahadeo he made all -- thorn for camel fodder for kine and mother ’ heart for sleepy head little son of mine little toomai came in with joyous tunk-a-tunk at end of each verse till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on fodder at kala nag ’ side at last elephants began lie down one after another as is their custom till only kala nag at right of line was left standing up ; and he rocked slowly from side side his ears put forward listen night wind as it blew very slowly across hills air was full of all night noises that taken together make one big silence -- click of one bamboo stem against other rustle of something alive in undergrowth scratch and squawk of half-waked bird ( birds are awake in night much more often than we imagine ) and fall of water ever so far away little toomai slept for some time and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight and kala nag was still standing up with his ears cocked little toomai turned rustling in fodder and watched curve of his big back against half stars in heaven and while he watched he heard so far away that it sounded no more than pinhole of noise pricked through stillness “ hoot-toot ” of wild elephant all elephants in lines jumped up as if they had been shot and their grunts at last waked sleeping mahouts and they came out and drove in picket pegs with big mallets and tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet one new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket and big toomai took off kala nag ’ leg chain and shackled that elephant fore-foot hind-foot but slipped loop of grass string round kala nag ’ leg and told him remember that he was tied fast he knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done very same thing hundreds of times before kala nag did not answer order by gurgling as he usually did he stood still looking out across moonlight his head little raised and his ears spread like fans up great folds of garo hills “ tend him if he grows restless in night ” said big toomai little toomai and he went into hut and slept little toomai was just going sleep when he heard coir string snap with little “ tang ” and kala nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as cloud rolls out of mouth of valley little toomai pattered after him barefooted down road in moonlight calling under his breath “ kala nag kala nag take with you kala nag ” elephant turned without sound took three strides back boy in moonlight put down his trunk swung him up his neck and almost before little toomai had settled his knees slipped into forest there was one blast of furious trumpeting from lines and then silence shut down on everything and kala nag began move sometimes tuft of high grass washed along his sides as wave washes along sides of ship and sometimes cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back or bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it but between those times he moved absolutely without any sound drifting through thick garo forest as though it had been smoke he was going uphill but though little toomai watched stars in rifts of trees he could not tell in what direction then kala nag reached crest of ascent and stopped for minute and little toomai could see tops of trees lying all speckled and furry under moonlight for miles and miles and blue-white mist over river in hollow toomai leaned forward and looked and he felt that forest was awake below him -- awake and alive and crowded big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear ; porcupine ’ quills rattled in thicket ; and in darkness between tree stems he heard hog-bear digging hard in moist warm earth and snuffing as it digged then branches closed over his head again and kala nag began go down into valley -- not quietly this time but as runaway gun goes down steep bank -- in one rush huge limbs moved as steadily as pistons eight feet each stride and wrinkled skin of elbow points rustled undergrowth on either side of him ripped with noise like torn canvas and saplings that he heaved away right and left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on flank and great trails of creepers all matted together hung from his tusks as he threw his head from side side and plowed out his pathway then little toomai laid himself down close great neck lest swinging bough should sweep him ground and he wished that he were back in lines again grass began get squashy and kala nag ’ feet sucked and squelched as he put them down and night mist at bottom of valley chilled little toomai there was splash and trample and rush of running water and kala nag strode through bed of river feeling his way at each step above noise of water as it swirled round elephant ’ legs little toomai could hear more splashing and some trumpeting both upstream and down -- great grunts and angry snortings and all mist about him seemed be full of rolling wavy shadows “ ai ” he said half aloud his teeth chattering “ elephant-folk are out tonight it is dance then ” kala nag swashed out of water blew his trunk clear and began another climb but this time he was not alone and he had not make his path that was made already six feet wide in front of him where bent jungle-grass was trying recover itself and stand up many elephants must have gone that way only few minutes before little toomai looked back and behind him great wild tusker with his little pig ’ eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of misty river then trees closed up again and they went on and up with trumpetings and crashings and sound of breaking branches on every side of them at last kala nag stood still between two tree-trunks at very top of hill they were part of circle of trees that grew round an irregular space of some three or four acres and in all that space as little toomai could see ground had been trampled down as hard as brick floor some trees grew in center of clearing but their bark was rubbed away and white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in patches of moonlight there were creepers hanging from upper branches and bells of flowers of creepers great waxy white things like convolvuluses hung down fast asleep but within limits of clearing there was not single blade of green -- nothing but trampled earth moonlight showed it all iron gray except where some elephants stood upon it and their shadows were inky black little toomai looked holding his breath with his eyes starting out of his head and as he looked more and more and more elephants swung out into open from between tree trunks little toomai could only count up ten and he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of tens and his head began swim outside clearing he could hear them crashing in undergrowth as they worked their way up hillside but as soon as they were within circle of tree trunks they moved like ghosts there were white-tusked wild males with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in wrinkles of their necks and folds of their ears ; fat slow-footed she-elephants with restless little pinky black calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs ; young elephants with their tusks just beginning show and very proud of them ; lanky scraggy old-maid elephants with their hollow anxious faces and trunks like rough bark ; savage old bull elephants scarred from shoulder flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights and caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their shoulders ; and there was one with broken tusk and marks of full-stroke terrible drawing scrape of tiger ’ claws on his side they were standing head head or walking and fro across ground in couples or rocking and swaying all by themselves -- scores and scores of elephants toomai knew that so long as he lay still on kala nag ’ neck nothing would happen him for even in rush and scramble of keddah drive wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag man off neck of tame elephant and these elephants were not thinking of men that night once they started and put their ears forward when they heard chinking of leg iron in forest but it was pudmini petersen sahib ’ pet elephant her chain snapped short off grunting snuffling up hillside she must have broken her pickets and come straight from petersen sahib ’ camp ; and little toomai saw another elephant one that he did not know with deep rope galls on his back and breast he must have run away from some camp in hills about at last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in forest and kala nag rolled out from his station between trees and went into middle of crowd clucking and gurgling and all elephants began talk in their own tongue and move about still lying down little toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs and wagging ears and tossing trunks and little rolling eyes he heard click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident and dry rustle of trunks twined together and chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in crowd and incessant flick and hissh of great tails then cloud came over moon and he sat in black darkness but quiet steady hustling and pushing and gurgling went on just same he knew that there were elephants all round kala nag and that there was no chance of backing him out of assembly ; so he set his teeth and shivered in keddah at least there was torchlight and shouting but here he was all alone in dark and once trunk came up and touched him on knee then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds dew from trees above spattered down like rain on unseen backs and dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toomai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then other and brought them down on ground -- one-two one-two as steadily as trip-hammers elephants were stamping all together now and it sounded like war drum beaten at mouth of cave dew fell from trees till there was no more left fall and booming went on and ground rocked and shivered and little toomai put his hands up his ears shut out sound but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him -- this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on raw earth once or twice he could feel kala nag and all others surge forward few strides and thumping would change crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised but in minute or two boom of feet on hard earth began again tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him he put out his arm and felt bark but kala nag moved forward still tramping and he could not tell where he was in clearing there was no sound from elephants except once when two or three little calves squeaked together then he heard thump and shuffle and booming went on it must have lasted fully two hours and little toomai ached in every nerve but he knew by smell of night air that dawn was coming morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind green hills and booming stopped with first ray as though light had been an order before little toomai had got ringing out of his head before even he had shifted his position there was not an elephant in sight except kala nag pudmini and elephant with rope-galls and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down hillsides show where others had gone little toomai stared again and again clearing as he remembered it had grown in night more trees stood in middle of it but undergrowth and jungle grass at sides had been rolled back little toomai stared once more now he understood trampling elephants had stamped out more room -- had stamped thick grass and juicy cane trash trash into slivers slivers into tiny fibers and fibers into hard earth “ wah ” said little toomai and his eyes were very heavy “ kala nag my lord let us keep by pudmini and go petersen sahib ’ camp or i shall drop from thy neck. ” third elephant watched two go away snorted wheeled round and took his own path he may have belonged some little native king ’ establishment fifty or sixty or hundred miles away two hours later as petersen sahib was eating early breakfast his elephants who had been double chained that night began trumpet and pudmini mired shoulders with kala nag very footsore shambled into camp little toomai ’ face was gray and pinched and his hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew but he tried salute petersen sahib and cried faintly : “ dance -- elephant dance i have seen it and -- i die ” as kala nag sat down he slid off his neck in dead faint but since native children have no nerves worth speaking of in two hours he was lying very contentedly in petersen sahib ’ hammock with petersen sahib ’ shooting-coat under his head and glass of warm milk little brandy with dash of quinine inside of him and while old hairy scarred hunters of jungles sat three deep before him looking at him as though he were spirit he told his tale in short words as child will and wound up with : “ now if i lie in one word send men see and they will find that elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room and they will find ten and ten and many times ten tracks leading that dance-room they made more room with their feet i have seen it kala nag took and i saw also kala nag is very leg-weary ” little toomai lay back and slept all through long afternoon and into twilight and while he slept petersen sahib and machua appa followed track of two elephants for fifteen miles across hills petersen sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants and he had only once before found such dance-place machua appa had no need look twice at clearing see what had been done there or scratch with his toe in packed rammed earth “ child speaks truth ” said he “ all this was done last night and i have counted seventy tracks crossing river see sahib where pudmini ’ leg-iron cut bark of that tree yes ; she was there too. ” they looked at one another and up and down and they wondered for ways of elephants are beyond wit of any man black or white fathom “ forty years and five ” said machua appa “ have i followed my lord elephant but never have i heard that any child of man had seen what this child has seen by all gods of hills it is -- what can we say ” and he shook his head when they got back camp it was time for evening meal petersen sahib ate alone in his tent but he gave orders that camp should have two sheep and some fowls as well as double ration of flour and rice and salt for he knew that there would be feast big toomai had come up hotfoot from camp in plains search for his son and his elephant and now that he had found them he looked at them as though he were afraid of them both and there was feast by blazing campfires in front of lines of picketed elephants and little toomai was hero of it all and big brown elephant catchers trackers and drivers and ropers and men who know all secrets of breaking wildest elephants passed him from one other and they marked his forehead with blood from breast of newly killed jungle-cock show that he was forester initiated and free of all jungles and at last when flames died down and red light of logs made elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood machua appa head of all drivers of all keddahs -- machua appa petersen sahib ’ other self who had never seen made road in forty years : machua appa who was so great that he had no other name than machua appa -- leaped his feet with little toomai held high in air above his head and shouted : “ listen my brothers listen you my lords in lines there for i machua appa am speaking this little one shall no more be called little toomai but toomai of elephants as his great-grandfather was called before him what never man has seen he has seen through long night and favor of elephant-folk and of gods of jungles is with him he shall become great tracker he shall become greater than i even i machua appa he shall follow new trail and stale trail and mixed trail with clear eye he shall take no harm in keddah when he runs under their bellies rope wild tuskers ; and if he slips before feet of charging bull elephant bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him aihai my lords in chains ” -- he whirled up line of pickets -- “ here is little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places -- sight that never man saw give him honor my lords salaam karo my children make your salute toomai of elephants gunga pershad ahaa hira guj birchi guj kuttar guj ahaa pudmini -- thou hast seen him at dance and thou kala nag my pearl among elephants -- ahaa together toomai of elephants barrao ” and at that last wild yell whole line flung up their trunks till tips touched their foreheads and broke out into full salute -- crashing trumpet-peal that only viceroy of india hears salaamut of keddah but it was all for sake of little toomai who had seen what never man had seen before -- dance of elephants at night and alone in heart of garo hills shiv and grasshopper ( song that toomai ’ mother sang baby ) shiv who poured harvest and made winds blow sitting at doorways of day of long ago gave each his portion food and toil and fate from king upon guddee beggar at gate all things made he -- shiva preserver mahadeo mahadeo he made all -- thorn for camel fodder for kine and mother ’ heart for sleepy

twist it you can turn it you can plait it till you drop but way of pilly winky ’ not way of winkie pop it had been raining heavily for one whole month -- raining on camp of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels elephants horses bullocks and mules all gathered together at place called rawal pindi be reviewed by viceroy of india he was receiving visit from amir of afghanistan -- wild king of very wild country amir had brought with him for bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who had never seen camp or locomotive before in their lives -- savage men and savage horses from somewhere at back of central asia every night mob of these horses would be sure break their heel ropes and stampede up and down camp through mud in dark or camels would break loose and run about and fall over ropes of tents and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying go sleep my tent lay far away from camel lines and i thought it was safe but one night man popped his head in and shouted “ get out quick they ’ coming my tent ’ gone ” i knew who “ they ” were so i put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out into slush little vixen my fox terrier went out through other side ; and then there was roaring and grunting and bubbling and i saw tent cave in as pole snapped and begin dance about like mad ghost camel had blundered into it and wet and angry as i was i could not help laughing then i ran on because i did not know how many camels might have got loose and before long i was out of sight of camp plowing my way through mud at last i fell over tail-end of gun and by that knew i was somewhere near artillery lines where cannon were stacked at night as i did not want plowter about any more in drizzle and dark i put my waterproof over muzzle of one gun and made sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that i found and lay along tail of another gun wondering where vixen had got and where i might be just as i was getting ready go sleep i heard jingle of harness and grunt and mule passed shaking his wet ears he belonged screw-gun battery for i could hear rattle of straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces that are screwed together when time comes use them they are taken up mountains anywhere that mule can find road and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country behind mule there was camel with his big soft feet squelching and slipping in mud and his neck bobbing and fro like strayed hen ’ luckily i knew enough of beast language -- not wild-beast language but camp-beast language of course -- from natives know what he was saying he must have been one that flopped into my tent for he called mule “ what shall i do where shall i go i have fought with white thing that waved and it took stick and hit on neck. ” ( that was my broken tent pole and i was very glad know it ) “ shall we run on ” “ oh it was you ” said mule “ you and your friends that have been disturbing camp all right you ’ be beaten for this in morning but i may as well give you something on account now. ” i heard harness jingle as mule backed and caught camel two kicks in ribs that rang like drum “ another time ” he said “ you ’ know better than run through mule battery at night shouting `thieves and fire ’ sit down and keep your silly neck quiet. ” camel doubled up camel-fashion like two-foot rule and sat down whimpering there was regular beat of hoofs in darkness and big troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade jumped gun tail and landed close mule “ it ’ disgraceful ” he said blowing out his nostrils “ those camels have racketed through our lines again -- third time this week how ’ horse keep his condition if he ’ allowed sleep who ’ here ” “ i ’ breech-piece mule of number two gun of first screw battery ” said mule “ and other ’ one of your friends he ’ waked up who are you ” “ number fifteen e troop ninth lancers -- dick cunliffe ’ horse stand over little there. ” “ oh beg your pardon ” said mule “ it ’ dark see much ’ these camels sickening for anything i walked out of my lines get little peace and quiet here. ” “ my lords ” said camel humbly “ we dreamed bad dreams in night and we were very much afraid i am only baggage camel of 39th native infantry and i am not as brave as you are my lords. ” “ then why ’ you stay and carry baggage for 39th native infantry instead of running all round camp ” said mule “ they were such very bad dreams ” said camel “ i am sorry listen what is that shall we run on again ” “ sit down ” said mule “ or you ’ snap your long stick-legs between guns. ” he cocked one ear and listened “ bullocks ” he said “ gun bullocks on my word you and your friends have waked camp very thoroughly it takes good deal of prodding put up gun-bullock. ” i heard chain dragging along ground and yoke of great sulky white bullocks that drag heavy siege guns when elephants won ’ go any nearer firing came shouldering along together and almost stepping on chain was another battery mule calling wildly for “ billy. ” “ that ’ one of our recruits ” said old mule troop horse “ he ’ calling for here youngster stop squealing dark never hurt anybody yet. ” gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing cud but young mule huddled close billy “ things ” he said “ fearful and horrible billy they came into our lines while we were asleep ’ you think they ’ kill us ” “ i ’ very great mind give you number-one kicking ” said billy “ idea of fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing battery before this gentleman ” “ gently gently ” said troop-horse “ remember they are always like this begin with first time i ever saw man ( it was in australia when i was three-year-old ) i ran for half day and if i ’ seen camel i should have been running still. ” nearly all our horses for english cavalry are brought india from australia and are broken in by troopers themselves “ true enough ” said billy “ stop shaking youngster first time they put full harness with all its chains on my back i stood on my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off i hadn ’ learned real science of kicking then but battery said they had never seen anything like it. ” “ but this ’ harness or anything that jingled ” said young mule “ you know i don ’ mind that now billy it was things like trees and they fell up and down lines and bubbled ; and my head-rope broke and i ’ find my driver and i ’ find you billy so i ran off with -- with these gentlemen. ” “ h ’ ” said billy “ as soon as i heard camels were loose i came away on my own account when battery -- screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen he must be very badly shaken up who are you fellows on ground there ” gun bullocks rolled their cuds and answered both together : “ seventh yoke of first gun of big gun battery we were asleep when camels came but when we were trampled on we got up and walked away it is better lie quiet in mud than be disturbed on good bedding we told your friend here that there was nothing be afraid of but he knew so much that he thought otherwise wah ” they went on chewing “ that comes of being afraid ” said billy “ you get laughed at by gun-bullocks i hope you like it young un. ” young mule ’ teeth snapped and i heard him say something about not being afraid of any beefy old bullock in world but bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on chewing “ now don ’ be angry after you ’ been afraid that ’ worst kind of cowardice ” said troop-horse “ anybody can be forgiven for being scared in night i think if they see things they don ’ understand we ’ broken out of our pickets again and again four hundred and fifty of us just because new recruit got telling tales of whip snakes at home in australia till we were scared death of loose ends of our head-ropes. ” “ that ’ all very well in camp ” said billy “ i ’ not above stampeding myself for fun of thing when i haven ’ been out for day or two but what do you do on active service ” “ oh that ’ quite another set of new shoes ” said troop horse “ dick cunliffe ’ on my back then and drives his knees into and all i have do is watch where i am putting my feet and keep my hind legs well under and be bridle-wise. ” “ what ’ bridle-wise ” said young mule “ by blue gums of back blocks ” snorted troop-horse “ do you mean say that you ’ taught be bridle-wise in your business how can you do anything unless you can spin round at once when rein is pressed on your neck it means life or death your man and of course that ’ life and death you get round with your hind legs under you instant you feel rein on your neck if you haven ’ room swing round rear up little and come round on your hind legs that ’ being bridle-wise. ” “ we ’ taught that way ” said billy mule stiffly “ we ’ taught obey man at our head : step off when he says so and step in when he says so i suppose it comes same thing now with all this fine fancy business and rearing which must be very bad for your hocks what do you do ” “ that depends ” said troop-horse “ generally i have go in among lot of yelling hairy men with knives -- long shiny knives worse than farrier ’ knives -- and i have take care that dick ’ boot is just touching next man ’ boot without crushing it i can see dick ’ lance right of my right eye and i know i ’ safe i ’ care be man or horse that stood up dick and when we ’ in hurry. ” “ don ’ knives hurt ” said young mule “ well i got one cut across chest once but that ’ dick ’ fault -- ” “ lot i should have cared whose fault it was if it hurt ” said young mule “ you must ” said troop horse “ if you don ’ trust your man you may as well run away at once that ’ what some of our horses do and i don ’ blame them as i was saying it ’ dick ’ fault man was lying on ground and i stretched myself not tread on him and he slashed up at next time i have go over man lying down i shall step on him -- hard. ” “ h ’ ” said billy “ it sounds very foolish knives are dirty things at any time proper thing do is climb up mountain with well-balanced saddle hang on by all four feet and your ears and creep and crawl and wriggle along till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on ledge where there ’ just room enough for your hoofs then you stand still and keep quiet -- never ask man hold your head young un -- keep quiet while guns are being put together and then you watch little poppy shells drop down into tree-tops ever so far below. ” “ don ’ you ever trip ” said troop-horse “ they say that when mule trips you can split hen ’ ear ” said billy “ now and again perhaps badly packed saddle will upset mule but it ’ very seldom i wish i could show you our business it ’ beautiful why it took three years find out what men were driving at science of thing is never show up against sky line because if you do you may get fired at remember that young un always keep hidden as much as possible even if you have go mile out of your way i lead battery when it comes that sort of climbing. ” “ fired at without chance of running into people who are firing ” said troop-horse thinking hard “ i ’ stand that i should want charge -- with dick. ” “ oh no you wouldn ’ you know that as soon as guns are in position they ’ do all charging that ’ scientific and neat but knives -- pah ” baggage-camel had been bobbing his head and fro for some time past anxious get word in edgewise then i heard him say as he cleared his throat nervously : “ i -- i -- i have fought little but not in that climbing way or that running way. ” “ no now you mention it ” said billy “ you don ’ look as though you were made for climbing or running -- much well how was it old hay-bales ” “ proper way ” said camel “ we all sat down -- ” “ oh my crupper and breastplate ” said troop-horse under his breath “ sat down ” “ we sat down -- hundred of us ” camel went on “ in big square and men piled our packs and saddles outside square and they fired over our backs men did on all sides of square. ” “ what sort of men any men that came along ” said troop-horse “ they teach us in riding school lie down and let our masters fire across us but dick cunliffe is only man i ’ trust do that it tickles my girths and besides i can ’ see with my head on ground. ” “ what does it matter who fires across you ” said camel “ there are plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by and great many clouds of smoke i am not frightened then i sit still and wait. ” “ and yet ” said billy “ you dream bad dreams and upset camp at night well well before i ’ lie down not speak of sitting down and let man fire across my heels and his head would have something say each other did you ever hear anything so awful as that ” there was long silence and then one of gun bullocks lifted up his big head and said “ this is very foolish indeed there is only one way of fighting. ” “ oh go on ” said billy “ please don ’ mind i suppose you fellows fight standing on your tails ” “ only one way ” said two together ( they must have been twins ) “ this is that way put all twenty yoke of us big gun as soon as two tails trumpets. ” ( “ two tails ” is camp slang for elephant ) “ what does two tails trumpet for ” said young mule “ show that he is not going any nearer smoke on other side two tails is great coward then we tug big gun all together -- heya -- hullah heeyah hullah we do not climb like cats nor run like calves we go across level plain twenty yoke of us till we are unyoked again and we graze while big guns talk across plain some town with mud walls and pieces of wall fall out and dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home. ” “ oh and you choose that time for grazing ” said young mule “ that time or any other eating is always good we eat till we are yoked up again and tug gun back where two tails is waiting for it sometimes there are big guns in city that speak back and some of us are killed and then there is all more grazing for those that are left this is fate none less two tails is great coward that is proper way fight we are brothers from hapur our father was sacred bull of shiva we have spoken. ” “ well i ’ certainly learned something tonight ” said troop-horse “ do you gentlemen of screw-gun battery feel inclined eat when you are being fired at with big guns and two tails is behind you ” “ about as much as we feel inclined sit down and let men sprawl all over us or run into people with knives i never heard such stuff mountain ledge well-balanced load driver you can trust let you pick your own way and i ’ your mule but -- other things -- no ” said billy with stamp of his foot “ of course ” said troop horse “ everyone is not made in same way and i can quite see that your family on your father ’ side would fail understand great many things. ” “ never you mind my family on my father ’ side ” said billy angrily for every mule hates be reminded that his father was donkey “ my father was southern gentleman and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every horse he came across remember that you big brown brumby ” brumby means wild horse without any breeding imagine feelings of sunol if car-horse called her “ skate ” and you can imagine how australian horse felt i saw white of his eye glitter in dark “ see here you son of an imported malaga jackass ” he said between his teeth “ i ’ have you know that i ’ related on my mother ’ side carbine winner of melbourne cup and where i come from we ’ accustomed being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed pig-headed mule in pop-gun pea-shooter battery are you ready ” “ on your hind legs ” squealed billy they both reared up facing each other and i was expecting furious fight when gurgly rumbly voice called out of darkness right -- “ children what are you fighting about there be quiet. ” both beasts dropped down with snort of disgust for neither horse nor mule can bear listen an elephant ’ voice “ it ’ two tails ” said troop-horse “ i can ’ stand him tail at each end ’ fair ” “ my feelings exactly ” said billy crowding into troop-horse for company “ we ’ very alike in some things. ” “ i suppose we ’ inherited them from our mothers ” said troop horse “ it ’ not worth quarreling about hi two tails are you tied up ” “ yes ” said two tails with laugh all up his trunk “ i ’ picketed for night i ’ heard what you fellows have been saying but don ’ be afraid i ’ not coming over. ” bullocks and camel said half aloud “ afraid of two tails -- what nonsense ” and bullocks went on “ we are sorry that you heard but it is true two tails why are you afraid of guns when they fire ” “ well ” said two tails rubbing one hind leg against other exactly like little boy saying poem “ i don ’ quite know whether you ’ understand. ” “ we don ’ but we have pull guns ” said bullocks “ i know it and i know you are good deal braver than you think you are but it ’ different with my battery captain called pachydermatous anachronism other day. ” “ that ’ another way of fighting i suppose ” said billy who was recovering his spirits “ you don ’ know what that means of course but i do it means betwixt and between and that is just where i am i can see inside my head what will happen when shell bursts and you bullocks can ’ t. ” “ i can ” said troop-horse “ at least little bit i try not think about it. ” “ i can see more than you and i do think about it i know there ’ great deal of take care of and i know that nobody knows how cure when i ’ sick all they can do is stop my driver ’ pay till i get well and i can ’ trust my driver. ” “ ah ” said troop horse “ that explains it i can trust dick. ” “ you could put whole regiment of dicks on my back without making feel any better i know just enough be uncomfortable and not enough go on in spite of it. ” “ we do not understand ” said bullocks “ i know you don ’ i ’ not talking you you don ’ know what blood is. ” “ we do ” said bullocks “ it is red stuff that soaks into ground and smells. ” troop-horse gave kick and bound and snort “ don ’ talk of it ” he said “ i can smell it now just thinking of it it makes want run -- when i haven ’ dick on my back. ” “ but it is not here ” said camel and bullocks “ why are you so stupid ” “ it ’ vile stuff ” said billy “ i don ’ want run but i don ’ want talk about it. ” “ there you are ” said two tails waving his tail explain “ surely yes we have been here all night ” said bullocks two tails stamped his foot till iron ring on it jingled “ oh i ’ not talking you you can ’ see inside your heads. ” “ no we see out of our four eyes ” said bullocks “ we see straight in front of us. ” “ if i could do that and nothing else you wouldn ’ be needed pull big guns at all if i was like my captain -- he can see things inside his head before firing begins and he shakes all over but he knows much run away -- if i was like him i could pull guns but if i were as wise as all that i should never be here i should be king in forest as i used be sleeping half day and bathing when i liked i haven ’ had good bath for month. ” “ that ’ all very fine ” said billy “ but giving thing long name ’ make it any better. ” “ h ’ sh ” said troop horse “ i think i understand what two tails means. ” “ you ’ understand better in minute ” said two tails angrily “ now you just explain why you don ’ like this ” he began trumpeting furiously at top of his trumpet “ stop that ” said billy and troop horse together and i could hear them stamp and shiver an elephant ’ trumpeting is always nasty especially on dark night “ i ’ stop ” said two tails “ won ’ you explain that please hhrrmph rrrt rrrmph rrrhha ” then he stopped suddenly and i heard little whimper in dark and knew that vixen had found at last she knew as well as i did that if there is one thing in world elephant is more afraid of than another it is little barking dog so she stopped bully two tails in his pickets and yapped round his big feet two tails shuffled and squeaked “ go away little dog ” he said “ don ’ snuff at my ankles or i ’ kick at you good little dog -- nice little doggie then go home you yelping little beast oh why ’ someone take her away she ’ bite in minute. ” “ seems ” said billy troop horse “ that our friend two tails is afraid of most things now if i had full meal for every dog i ’ kicked across parade-ground i should be as fat as two tails nearly. ” i whistled and vixen ran up muddy all over and licked my nose and told long tale about hunting for all through camp i never let her know that i understood beast talk or she would have taken all sorts of liberties so i buttoned her into breast of my overcoat and two tails shuffled and stamped and growled himself “ extraordinary most extraordinary ” he said “ it runs in our family now where has that nasty little beast gone ” i heard him feeling about with his trunk “ we all seem be affected in various ways ” he went on blowing his nose “ now you gentlemen were alarmed i believe when i trumpeted. ” “ not alarmed exactly ” said troop-horse “ but it made feel as though i had hornets where my saddle ought be don ’ begin again. ” “ i ’ frightened of little dog and camel here is frightened by bad dreams in night. ” “ it is very lucky for us that we haven ’ all got fight in same way ” said troop-horse “ what i want know ” said young mule who had been quiet for long time -- “ what i want know is why we have fight at all. ” “ because we ’ told ” said troop-horse with snort of contempt “ orders ” said billy mule and his teeth snapped “ hukm hai ” ( it is an order ) said camel with gurgle and two tails and bullocks repeated “ hukm hai ” “ yes but who gives orders ” said recruit-mule “ man who walks at your head -- or sits on your back -- or holds nose rope -- or twists your tail ” said billy and troop-horse and camel and bullocks one after other “ but who gives them orders ” “ now you want know much young un ” said billy “ and that is one way of getting kicked all you have do is obey man at your head and ask no questions. ” “ he ’ quite right ” said two tails “ i can ’ always obey because i ’ betwixt and between but billy ’ right obey man next you who gives order or you ’ stop all battery besides getting thrashing. ” gun-bullocks got up go “ morning is coming ” they said “ we will go back our lines it is true that we only see out of our eyes and we are not very clever but still we are only people to-night who have not been afraid good-night you brave people. ” nobody answered and troop-horse said change conversation “ where ’ that little dog dog means man somewhere about. ” “ here i am ” yapped vixen “ under gun tail with my man you big blundering beast of camel you you upset our tent my man ’ very angry. ” “ phew ” said bullocks “ he must be white ” “ of course he is ” said vixen “ do you suppose i ’ looked after by black bullock-driver ” “ huah ouach ugh ” said bullocks “ let us get away quickly. ” they plunged forward in mud and managed somehow run their yoke on pole of an ammunition wagon where it jammed “ now you have done it ” said billy calmly “ don ’ struggle you ’ hung up till daylight what on earth ’ matter ” bullocks went off into long hissing snorts that indian cattle give and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in mud grunting savagely “ you ’ break your necks in minute ” said troop-horse “ what ’ matter with white men i live with ‘ em. ” “ they -- eat -- us pull ” said near bullock yoke snapped with twang and they lumbered off together i never knew before what made indian cattle so scared of englishmen we eat beef -- thing that no cattle-driver touches -- and of course cattle do not like it “ may i be flogged with my own pad-chains who ’ have thought of two big lumps like those losing their heads ” said billy “ never mind i ’ going look at this man most of white men i know have things in their pockets ” said troop-horse “ i ’ leave you then i can ’ say i ’ over-fond of ‘ em myself besides white men who haven ’ place sleep in are more than likely be thieves and i ’ good deal of government property on my back come along young un and we ’ go back our lines good-night australia see you on parade to-morrow i suppose good-night old hay-bale -- try control your feelings won ’ you good-night two tails if you pass us on ground tomorrow don ’ trumpet it spoils our formation. ” billy mule stumped off with swaggering limp of an old campaigner as troop-horse ’ head came nuzzling into my breast and i gave him biscuits while vixen who is most conceited little dog told him fibs about scores of horses that she and i kept “ i ’ coming parade to-morrow in my dog-cart ” she said “ where will you be ” “ on left hand of second squadron i set time for all my troop little lady ” he said politely “ now i must go back dick my tail ’ all muddy and he ’ have two hours ’ hard work dressing for parade. ” big parade of all thirty thousand men was held that afternoon and vixen and i had good place close viceroy and amir of afghanistan with high big black hat of astrakhan wool and great diamond star in center first part of review was all sunshine and regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving together and guns all in line till our eyes grew dizzy then cavalry came up beautiful cavalry canter of “ bonnie dundee ” and vixen cocked her ear where she sat on dog-cart second squadron of lancers shot by and there was troop-horse with his tail like spun silk his head pulled into his breast one ear forward and one back setting time for all his squadron his legs going as smoothly as waltz music then big guns came by and i saw two tails and two other elephants harnessed in line forty-pounder siege gun while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind seventh pair had new yoke and they looked rather stiff and tired last came screw guns and billy mule carried himself as though he commanded all troops and his harness was oiled and polished till it winked i gave cheer all by myself for billy mule but he never looked right or left rain began fall again and for while it was misty see what troops were doing they had made big half circle across plain and were spreading out into line that line grew and grew and grew till it was three-quarters of mile long from wing wing -- one solid wall of men horses and guns then it came on straight toward viceroy and amir and as it got nearer ground began shake like deck of steamer when engines are going fast unless you have been there you can not imagine what frightening effect this steady come-down of troops has on spectators even when they know it is only review i looked at amir up till then he had not shown shadow of sign of astonishment or anything else but now his eyes began get bigger and bigger and he picked up reins on his horse ’ neck and looked behind him for minute it seemed as though he were going draw his sword and slash his way out through english men and women in carriages at back then advance stopped dead ground stood still whole line saluted and thirty bands began play all together that was end of review and regiments went off their camps in rain and an infantry band struck up with -- animals went in two by two hurrah animals went in two by two elephant and battery mul ’ and they all got into ark for get out of rain then i heard an old grizzled long-haired central asian chief who had come down with amir asking questions of native officer “ now ” said he “ in what manner was this wonderful thing done ” and officer answered “ an order was given and they obeyed. ” “ but are beasts as wise as men ” said chief “ they obey as men do mule horse elephant or bullock he obeys his driver and driver his sergeant and sergeant his lieutenant and lieutenant his captain and captain his major and major his colonel and colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments and brigadier general who obeys viceroy who is servant of empress thus it is done. ” “ would it were so in afghanistan ” said chief “ for there we obey only our own wills. ” “ and for that reason ” said native officer twirling his mustache “ your amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our viceroy. ” parade song of camp animals elephants of gun teams we lent alexander strength of hercules wisdom of our foreheads cunning of our knees ; we bowed our necks service : they ne ’ er were loosed again -- make way there -- way for ten-foot teams of forty-pounder train gun bullocks those heroes in their harnesses avoid cannon-ball and what they know of powder upsets them one and all ; then we come into action and tug guns again -- make way there -- way for twenty yoke of forty-pounder train cavalry horses by brand on my shoulder finest of tunes is played by lancers hussars and dragoons and it ’ sweeter than “ stables ” or “ water ” -- cavalry canter of “ bonnie dundee ” then feed us and break us and handle and groom and give us good riders and plenty of room and launch us in column of squadron and see way of war-horse “ bonnie dundee ” screw-gun mules as and my companions were scrambling up hill path was lost in rolling stones but we went forward still ; for we can wriggle and climb my lads and turn up everywhere oh
